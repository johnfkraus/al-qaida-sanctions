To that end he agreed, together with his brother, Yasser Abu Shaweesh, and Khalil, jointly to commit a series of life insurance frauds (totaling 4,325,958 Euros in benefits). Yasser Abu Shaweesh was to take out life insurance and subsequently fake a fatal traffic accident in Egypt. Ismail Abu Shaweesh, named as the beneficiary of the insurance policies, was, together with Khalil, to ensure that the insured sums were paid out by means of a false death certificate and a faked Egyptian police accident report. The plan was to pass the proceeds of the fraud to Al-Qaida by a bank transfer via foreign bank accounts to fund Al-Qaida's terrorist activities. Throughout the process, Ismail Abu Shaweesh was in full knowledge that the funds would go to support Al-Qaida.</p> <p>Ismail Abu Shaweesh was convicted in Germany on 5 December 2007 of supporting a terrorist organization and attempted fraud, and was sentenced to three and a half years of imprisonment.</p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Ibrahim Mohamad Khalil (QI.M.206.05), listed on 6 December 2005<br> Yasser Mohamed Ismail Abu Shaweesh (QI.A.201.05), listed on 6 December 2005</p>
