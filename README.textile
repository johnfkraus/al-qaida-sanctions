h2.  Preparing the data

Note: The United Nations published data format may have changed over time, which could break the code in this application.

Download the AQList.xml file from the link shown above under Data Sources.

Using the AQList-to-d3.xsl stylesheet, transform the AQList.xml to the AQ-d3.xml format.

Convert the AQ-d3.xml file to JSON with the following filename: al-qaeda.json, and put the new JSON file in the data directory.

Remove the root node from the al-qaida.json file.
Make sure the al-qaida.json data file starts off with something like this:

<pre>
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "match": 1,
      "name": "Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso (no longer listed)",
      "artist": "QI.A.288.10",
      "id": "QI.A.288.10",
      "playcount": 100
    }, {
    ...
    }
</pre>



h2. Running

Running apache2 on codio.
http://shadow-context.codio.io:3000/

or

Running build-in HTTP server on custom port 63342 in WebStorm.
http://localhost:63342/aqlist-visualization/index.html

Running in xampp/tomcat/webapps.


Interesting irrelevant facts:

You can start up a local webserver by using python's simple server:

<pre>
python -m SimpleHTTTPServer -p 3000
</pre>

or @thin@ in ruby

<pre>
thin start
# might have to run 'bundle install' first
</pre>


h2.  To Do

Import the narrative pages and collect additional nodes.
Add click to documentation for each node.
