Syawal received training in the Al-Qaida operated Chaldun Camp in Afghanistan in the l980s or l990s. When he returned to South-East Asia, he became involved in sectarian conflicts in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Syawal, who is the son-in-law of JI co-founder Abdullah Sungkar, collaborated with individuals associated with JI and Al-Qaida in South-East Asia to recruit and train individuals for combat in Sulawesi. Syawal also assisted in importing weapons from the Philippines for use in conflicts in Indonesia. In addition, Syawal participated in planning and facilitating Al-Qaida terrorist plots in South-East Asia. In 1999, Syawal attended a planning session to select assassination targets.

Syawal remained at large as at December 2003.
