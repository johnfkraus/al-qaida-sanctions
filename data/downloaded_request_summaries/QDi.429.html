      Mohammad Ali al Habbo is a Syrian businessman at the head of the “al Khaldi” currency exchange network operating in the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey. The network was particularly active at the time when Raqqa was designated as the “capital” of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115).  During that period, Mohammad Ali al Habbo was able to channel via the “al Khaldi” network $2-3 million on a monthly basis from the territory held by ISIL to Turkey.

      The “al Khaldi” currency exchange network is also the main means through which foreign terrorist fighters located in the Syrian Arab Republic receive international transfers of funds over $1,000.

      Located in Turkey since 2016, Mohammad Ali al Habbo continues to pose a threat as he remains actively engaged in support of ISIL. In March 2017, he assisted Salim Mustafa Muhammad al-Mansur (QDi.411) in channelling $1 million out of Raqqa.
