      Ansar al-Islam, formerly known as Jund al-Islam, is a terrorist group operating in northeastern Iraq with close links to and support from Al-Qaida (QDe.004). Al-Qaida and Usama bin Laden (deceased) participated in the formation and funding of Ansar al-Islam, and Ansar al-Islam has provided safe haven to Al-Qaida in northeastern Iraq. Ansar al-Islam’s predecessor, Jund al-Islam, was formed in September 2001. Ansar al-Islam came into being with the blessing of Bin Laden after its leaders visited Al-Qaida in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001. Bin Laden provided Ansar al-Islam with an estimated USD 300,000 to USD 600,000 in seed money.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ansar al-Islam has received training and logistical assistance from Al-Qaida. Members of Ansar al-Islam have traveled to Afghanistan to train with the organization, while Ansar al-Islam’s non-Iraqi members are believed to be Al-Qaida trained veterans of conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya, the Russian Federation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ansar al-Islam also cooperated closely with senior Al-Qaida operative Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), also known as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose network established a poisons and explosives training center in northeastern Iraq controlled by Ansar al-Islam. Zarqawi’s lieutenants helped run this camp, which has taught operatives how to produce ricin and other poisons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ansar al-Islam has conducted attacks in northeastern Iraq. This organization has been located and primarily active in northern Iraq, but also maintained a presence in western and central Iraq.
