      Mustafa Hajji Muhammad Khan has been an Al-Qaida (QDe.004) facilitator, courier and operative since at least 2003. As of 2010, Khan was facilitating the activities of senior Pakistan-based Al-Qaida operatives and had overseen the travel of Al-Qaida members, including by escorting an individual to meet another Al-Qaida member in 2009. Khan recruited a facilitator who helped him move people and money between Gulf countries and Pakistan on behalf of Al-Qaida. In 2007, Khan helped Al-Qaida reestablish logistic support networks in Pakistan. Khan was tasked with regularly contacting an incarcerated Al-Qaida member’s relative regarding the provision of Al-Qaida’s financial support.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (deceased), and to deliver a message to him. Khan was found in possession of a letter he was attempting to deliver from Al-Zarqawi to Usama bin Laden (deceased), who was killed on 1 May 2011, and Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006).
