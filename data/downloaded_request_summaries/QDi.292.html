     <p>
      Othman Ahmed Othman al-Ghamdi is a member of the leadership of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QDe.129). Al-Ghamdi appeared in a video released in May 2010 in which he was identified as AQAP’s operational commander. In the same video, he appears alongside Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QDi.282), AQAP’s senior operations commander, and Fahd al-Quso (deceased), an AQAP operative wanted for his role in the 2000 USS Cole bombing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Al-Ghamdi originally became involved in terrorism in 2000, when he deserted his post in the Saudi military in order to fight against the Russian authorities in Chechnya. However, he abandoned his plan to travel to Chechnya when he joined Al-Qaida (QDe.004). He attended Al-Qaida’s Al-Farouq training camp in Afghanistan and subsequently fought for the Taliban against the Northern Alliance for over one year.
     </p>
     <p>
      After being detained for five years following the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, Al-Ghamdi was repatriated to Saudi Arabia. He eventually left Saudi Arabia and illegally entered Yemen to join AQAP.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since joining AQAP, he has been involved in raising funds for the organization’s operations and activities in Yemen. He has also planned attacks and stockpiled weapons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Al-Ghamdi is the subject of Orange and Red Interpol Notices, which note that he is considered armed, violent and highly dangerous. These notices also warn that Al-Ghamdi may carry out terrorist attacks. A Saudi Arabian citizen, Al-Ghamdi is included on Saudi Arabia’s list of 85 most wanted terrorists.
