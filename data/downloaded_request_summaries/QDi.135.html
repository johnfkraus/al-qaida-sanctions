      Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar has used his position as one of the most prominent criminals of the Indian underworld for most of the past two decades to support Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and related groups. In particular, his criminal syndicate has been involved in large-scale shipments of narcotics, and has shared its smuggling routes from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa with Usama bin Laden (deceased) and his terrorist network. A financial arrangement was brokered to facilitate their usage of these routes. In the late 1990s, Kaskar traveled to Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban.

     <p>
      Information from 2002 indicates that Kaskar had financially supported Al-Qaida-related groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) (QDe.118). For example, this information indicates that he had been helping finance attacks in Gujarat, India, by LeT.

      Kaskar is also wanted in India in connection with the 12 March 1993 Bombay Exchange bombings, which killed over 250 people and injured over one thousand more.

      Kaskar, his criminal band known as “D” company and other associates continue to engage in criminal activity in India and Nepal. This includes conspiracy to kill political leaders and counterfeiting currencies.
