     <p>
      Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (HUJI) is a violent extremist group operating throughout South Asia, which has carried out numerous terrorist attacks in India and Pakistan.
     </p>
     <p>
      HUJI’s relationship with Al-Qaida (QDe.004) developed after the Taliban’s rise in Afghanistan, and included its members training in Al-Qaida camps. By 2005, Mohammad Ilyas Kashmiri (deceased), a HUJI leader, coordinated activities with the Taliban and Al-Qaida from Waziristan. Kashmiri issued a statement in October 2009 (after he had been reported as deceased) that he was alive and working with Al-Qaida. By 2010, a significant number of HUJI operatives were involved in terrorist operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan.
     </p>
     <p>
      HUJI has planned and carried out a number of terrorist attacks in recent years. A HUJI leader planned the suicide bombing of the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, which killed four people and injured 48 on 2 March 2006. On 18 May 2007, HUJI and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118) conducted a joint bombing operation against the historic mosque in Hyderabad, India, which killed 16 people and injured 40. HUJI also killed 42 people and injured 50 with twin explosions on 25 August 2007 in Hyderabad, India. Moreover, on 23 November 2007, near simultaneous blasts outside courts in Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow, India, killed at least 13 people and injured 59. HUJI is believed to be responsible for these attacks. Ilyas Kashmiri (deceased) has been indicted in the United States for providing material support to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba operative David Coleman Headley who planned a terrorist attack against the Jyllands-Posten newspaper offices in Denmark.
     </p>
     <p>
      Detained HUJI leader Jalaluddin (a.k.a. Babu Bhai) has admitted HUJI’s involvement in funding the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. Part of the ransom paid in a July 2001 HUJI-executed kidnapping was funneled to 11 September hijacker Mohammad Atta via HUJI leader Mohammad Asif Raza and another individual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Composed primarily of Pakistani nationals and veterans of the Soviet-Afghan war, HUJI was originally founded in 1980 in Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet Union. HUJI later re-focused its efforts in South Asia following the Soviet withdrawal. In 1991, a faction broke away from the group to form Harakat ul-Mujahidin / HUM (QDe.008). In 1993, HUJI re-joined with HUM to form Harakat ul-Ansar (HUA). In 1997, HUJI split from the HUA organization and resumed using its former name.
