      The Wafa Humanitarian Organization has supported the Taliban and financed Al-Qaida (QDe.004). Documents found in Wafa’s offices in Afghanistan revealed that the organization was intimately involved in assassination plots against American citizens, as well as the distribution of “how to” manuals on chemical and biological warfare. Wafa is a component of Al-Qaida.
