     <p>
      Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI was established between 1982 and 1984 and, along with other organizations, sought to overthrow the government in Somalia. AIAI’s leadership has included Hassan Dahir Aweys (QDi.042). AIAI began its alliance with Al-Qaida (QDe.004) in 1993 and Usama bin Laden (deceased) devoted substantial funds towards the establishment of an AIAI-administered authority in Somalia, which supported the ultimate aim of setting up an Al-Qaida base of operations there. AIAI later supported Al-Qaida’s bombing of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on 7 August 1998. AIAI also supported Al-Qaida’s bomb attack on the Paradise Hotel in Kikambala and the simultaneous attack against a civilian airliner in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2002.
