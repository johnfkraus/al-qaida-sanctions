      Fared Saal took part in fighting in the Syrian Arab Republic coastal province of Durin, near the Turkish border, as a member of a terrorist group established in 2004, which first appeared in the media in early August 2013. From then on, its videos and images were primarily published by the German-language violent extremist media outlet
      <em>
       Sham Center
      </em>
      . In August 2013, this terrorist group fought the Syrian Government troops on several occasions, including taking part in a major offensive against Alawite villages. The leader of this group originates from Georgia and fought for Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131) for many years.

      Despite a declaration of adherence to Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137) by this terrorist group, the group remains a distinct organization. A video related to the attack on Aleppo prison on 6 February 2014 shows that the group's leader was still acting separately and not as a part of the Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137).

      Saal appeared in videos entitled “The Mujahedin carry out an operation in Latakia” and “A lecture by Abu Talha al Almani — Holiday greetings”, which were posted on the Internet at the end of August 2013. At the end of December 2013, Saal switched to be a fighter of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115). Via the Internet he glorified ISIL’s activities, reported on the fighting and called on his followers to come to Syrian Arab Republic and join ISIL as fighters.

      Saal took part with other ISIL fighters in the attack on the Sha’ar gas field near Homs in the Syrian Arab Republic on 17 July 2014. In this attack, Saal and his fellow fighters killed at least 90 people, including many civilians working at the plant. Saal can be seen and heard in three videos subsequently recorded in the vicinity of the gas field and then posted on the Internet.

      Saal remains an active member of ISIL in Syria.
