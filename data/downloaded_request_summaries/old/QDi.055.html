      Mahmood Sultan Bashir-Ud-Din is a nuclear scientist who founded and served as a director of Ummah Tameer e-Nau (UTN) (QDe.068). Other directors of UTN included Majeed Abdul Chaudhry (QDi.054) and Mohammed Tufail (QDi.056).
     </p>
     <p>
      UTN provided Usama bin Laden (deceased) and the Taliban with information about chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. During UTN visits to Afghanistan, Bashir-Ud-Din met Bin Laden and Al-Qaida (QDe.004) leaders and discussed nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 2001, Bashir-Ud-Din also met Mullah Omar, listed as Mohammed Omar Ghulam Nabi (TAi.004, on the 1988 Sanctions List). During a follow-up meeting, an associate of Usama bin Laden indicated that he had nuclear material and wanted to know how to use it to make a weapon. Bashir-Ud-Din provided information about the infrastructure needed for a nuclear weapons program and the effects of nuclear weapons.
     </p>
     <p>
      In November 2001, the Taliban left Kabul and the workers at UTN's Kabul offices fled the area with them. Searches of UTN locations in Kabul yielded documents setting out a plan to kidnap a U.S. attaché and outlining basic nuclear physics related to nuclear weapons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bashir-Ud-Din also provided financial support to the Taliban. He reportedly established UTN to rebuild Afghanistan's infrastructure and raise money to develop the Taliban-held areas of Afghanistan.
