      Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis-Sudan, also known as Ansaru, is an armed splinter group of Jama'atu Ahlis-Sunna Lidda'Awati Wal Jihad (Boko Haram) (QDe.138). Ansaru publicly announced its existence in January 2012. It has carried out terrorist attacks in Nigeria. Ansaru shares ideological similarities with the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) (QDe.014) and maintains operational connections with AQIM, including training and attack planning. The structure and leadership of Ansaru is unclear.

      Ansaru’s attacks typically target non-Nigerian civilians living or working in Nigeria and Nigerian security personnel. On 26 November 2012, Ansaru attacked the Nigerian Headquarters of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, freeing many detainees. In December 2012, Ansaru claimed responsibility for kidnapping a French national stating that its motivation was linked to the planned French intervention in Mali.

      In January 2013, Ansaru attacked a convoy of Nigerian peacekeepers heading to Mali which resulted in the death of two Nigerian peacekeepers and wounding another seven. Ansaru again referenced the international intervention in Mali as a motivation for the attack. Seven foreign workers employed by a Lebanese-owned construction company in the Jama’are Local Government Area of Bauchi State were executed by Ansaru following a second brutal kidnapping in February 2013. Ansaru directly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and killing.
