      Abdul Rahman Yasin assisted Ramzi Ahmed Yousef to carry out an attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, United States in February 1993. Yousef and Yasin drove a van full of explosives into the basement of the World Trade Center; the explosion killed six and wounded over one thousand people. Yasin fled the United States immediately after the bombing to avoid arrest. After the bombing, law enforcement officials obtained evidence which led to the indictment of several suspected terrorists involved in the bombing, including Yasin.
