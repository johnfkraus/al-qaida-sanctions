      Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi was a founding member of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) (QDe.118) and deputy to LeT emir Hafiz Muhammad Saeed (QDi.263). Bhuttavi served as the acting emir of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba/Jamaat-ud-Dawa (LeT/JuD) on at least two occasions when Saeed was detained. Saeed was detained days after the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and held until June 2009. Bhuttavi handled the group's day-to-day functions during this period, and made independent decisions on behalf of the organization. Saeed was also detained in May 2002.

Bhuttavi helped prepare the operatives for the November 2008 terrorist assault in Mumbai, India, by delivering lectures on the merits of martyrdom operations. The Mumbai attacks killed over 150 people and injured many more. Bhuttavi is responsible for LeT/JuD's madrassah (religious school) network. In mid-2002, Bhuttavi was in charge of establishing an LeT organizational base in Lahore, Pakistan.
