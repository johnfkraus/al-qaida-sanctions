     <p>
      Egyptian Muhammad Muhammad Jamal Abd-Al Rahim Ahmad Al-Kashif formed the MJN after his release from prison in 2011 and established multiple terrorist training camps in Egypt and Libya. AQAP (QDe.129) has provided funding to the MJN.
     </p>
     <p>
      Muhammad Jamal was most recently arrested by Egyptian authorities in November 2012. His confiscated computer contained letters to Al-Qaida leader Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) in which Muhammad Jamal described MJN’s activities as including acquiring weapons, conducting training, and establishing terrorist groups in the Sinai, and in which he asked Al-Zawahiri for assistance. Al-Zawahiri reportedly gave Jamal the go-ahead to launch terrorist attacks in Egypt, Libya, and elsewhere.
     </p>
     <p>
      Muhammad Jamal has used the Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) network to smuggle fighters into MJN training camps. Suicide bombers are being trained at MJN training camps, and Muhammad Jamal has established links with violent extremists in Europe. Muhammad Jamal set up a training camp in Libya where Libyan and foreign violent extremists were trained. Some of the attackers of the U.S. Mission in Benghazi on 11 September 2012 have been identified as associates of Muhammad Jamal, and some of the Benghazi attackers reportedly trained at MJN camps in Libya.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before he was arrested in November 2012, Muhammad Jamal was the leader of the Nasr City Cell (the Cell), whose members have been accused of plotting terrorist attacks inside Egypt. Raids against the Cell in October 2012 recovered a large amount of weapons, explosives, and related material.
     </p>
     <p>
      MJN is connected to Al-Qaida senior leaders, including Aiman al-Zawahiri, and AQAP leaders Nasir ‘abd-al-Karim ‘Abdullah al-Wahishi (deceased) and Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QDi.282). MJN is also connected to The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.
