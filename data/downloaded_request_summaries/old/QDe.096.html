      Lashkar i Jhangvi (LJ) emerged in 1996. It is based primarily in Pakistan’s Punjab region and in the city of Karachi. While LJ initially directed most of its attacks against the Pakistani Shia Muslim community, it claimed responsibility for the 1997 killing of four American oil workers in Karachi, Pakistan. It was responsible for the January 2002 kidnapping and killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl. LJ was also responsible for a March 2002 bus bombing in Karachi that killed 15 people, including 11 French citizens. In July 2002, Pakistani police arrested four LJ members for their role in the bombing of a church in Islamabad in March 2002, which killed two American citizens. The LJ members confessed to the killings.
