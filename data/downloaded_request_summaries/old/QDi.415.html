      Adnan Abou Walid al-Sahraoui was a former spokesperson of the Mouvement pour l’Unification et le Jihad en Afrique de l’Ouest (MUJAO) (QDe.134), he joined Al-Mourabitoun (QDe.141) at the time of its creation in August 2013.

      In May 2015, Adnan Abou Walid al-Sahraoui announced his allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115) and proclaimed himself emir of the Al-Mourabitoun group in Mali. This provoked a negative response from Mokhtar Belmokhtar (QDi.136) and resulted in a split by al-Sahraoui and his followers. In October 2016, ISIL acknowledged it received a pledge of allegiance from the group under al-Sahraoui.
      <br/>
      The group al-Sahraoui commands was composed of fighters of Fulani, Tuareg, and Sahraoui origin. It mostly targeted security forces in Niger and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) at the border between Niger and Mali. He ordered several kidnappings of foreigners, including Australian citizen Kenneth Elliot. On January 2018, the group claimed responsibility for attacks against international forces, including the Tongo Tongo attack on 4 October 2017, which led to the death of four American soldiers and five Nigerien soldiers.

      Adnan Abou Walid al-Sahraoui was reportedly killed in 2021.
