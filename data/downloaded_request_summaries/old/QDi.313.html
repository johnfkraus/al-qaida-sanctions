      Djamel Akkacha was listed on 5 February 2013 pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of resolution 2083 (2012) as being associated with Al-Qaida for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of”, or “otherwise supporting acts or activities of” an entity on the Al-Qaida Sanctions List, that is, the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014) (AQIM).

      Akkacha joined the Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006) in early 1997 and was arrested and jailed in 1998. Released in 2000, he joined the former Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), listed as the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014) (AQIM), and became the leader of a terrorist cell.
      <br/>
      In 2003, he went to northern Mali, where he joined Al Moulathamoun (QDe.140), headed by Mokhtar Belmokhtar (QDi.136). Until late 2007, he led a terrorist cell.
      <br/>
      In 2008, owing to differences with Mokhtar Belmokhtar, he joined Amor Mohamed Ghedeir (QDi.250) and his Katibat Tarek Ibn Ziad, to lead a sub-group.
      <br/>
      Following a disagreement with Amor Mohamed Ghedeir about the treatment of hostages, Akkacha became relatively independent of Katibat Tarek Ibn Ziad.
      <br/>
      In 2009, he became a member of the committee established by AQIM for the acquisition and management of weapons for the group.
      <br/>
      On 9 August 2009 he claimed responsibility for the suicide attack carried out the day before (8 August) against the French Embassy in Nouakchott.
      <br/>
      He was responsible for several terrorist acts in Mauritania carried out in retaliation for the arrests of terrorists by the Mauritanian security services.
      <br/>
      Akkacha was also responsible for the kidnapping of two Italian nationals in Mauritania and for attacks against military barracks in Mauritania and Mali.
      <br/>
      On 3 October 2012, he was appointed by Abdelmalek Droukdel (QDi.232), head of AQIM, to the position of coordinator of the terrorist groups in the Sahel, with Amor Mohamed Ghedeir as his deputy.
      <br/>
      Akkacha was reportedly killed in Mali in February 2019.
