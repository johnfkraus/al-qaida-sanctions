                            <div class="field-item even"><p>The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) was founded in the early 1990s by
                                Abdurajak Janjalani. It was formed from the more militant elements of the Moro National
                                Liberation Front, an established separatist movement in the southern Philippines. ASG is
                                based in the southern Philippines, primarily the Sulu archipelago, Tawi Tawi, Basilan
                                and Mindanao. Members also occasionally travel to Manila. ASG often resorts to criminal
                                activity, including murders, bombings, extortion and kidnap for ransom both for
                                financial profit and to promote its agenda.</p>

                                <p>Abdurajak Janjalani was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998.
                                    His younger brother replaced him as the leader of the group and was killed in a gun
                                    battle with the Armed Forces of the Philippines in September 2006. Then&nbsp;Radulan
                                    Sahiron (QDi.208) became the new ASG leader.</p>

                                <p>ASG has links to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092), and ASG
                                    members have been trained by both organizations in guerrilla warfare, military
                                    operations and bomb making. Usama bin Laden’s (deceased) brother-in-law, Mohammad
                                    Jammal Khalifa, used an organization to channel funds to ASG to pay for training and
                                    arms.</p>

                                <p>ASG has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including assassinations;
                                    bombing civilian and military establishments and domestic infrastructure, including
                                    airports and ferries;<u> </u>kidnapping local officials and foreign tourists;
                                    beheading local and foreign hostages; and extortion against local and foreign
                                    businesses. For example:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>in April 2000, an ASG group kidnapped 21 people from a Malaysian holiday
                                        resort;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>in May 2001, ASG members kidnapped three American citizens and 17 Filipinos from
                                        a resort in Palawan, Philippines. They later murdered several of the hostages;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>on 27 February 2004, ASG members bombed a ferry in Manila Bay, killing 116;</li>
                                    <li>on 14 February 2005, ASG members carried out simultaneous bombings in the cities
                                        of Manila, General Santos, and Davao, killing at least eight and injuring about
                                        150;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>in 2006,&nbsp; a group under the ASG leader relocated to Sulu, where it joined
                                        forces with local ASG supporters who provided shelter to fugitive JI members
                                        from Indonesia;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>in July 2007, ASG and Moro Islamic Liberation Front members fought Philippine
                                        marines on Basilan Island, killing 14;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>in November 2007, a motorcycle bomb exploded outside the Philippine Congress,
                                        killing a Congressman and three staff members. While there was no definitive
                                        claim of responsibility, three suspected ASG members were arrested during a
                                        subsequent raid on a safe-house;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>in January 2009, ASG kidnapped three International Red Cross workers in Sulu
                                        province, holding one of the hostages for six months.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
