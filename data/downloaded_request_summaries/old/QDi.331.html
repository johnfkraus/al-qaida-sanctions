      Anders Cameroon Ostensvig Dale is a Norwegian who is a member of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) (QDe.129). Dale made his first trip to Yemen in 2008 and has returned multiple times. As a member of AQAP, Dale has received terrorist training and was taught to make bomb-belts, improvised explosive devices, and larger explosives used in car bombs. Dale’s ability to travel to many countries without visa restrictions has the potential to be used by AQAP to carry out an attack in those countries.
