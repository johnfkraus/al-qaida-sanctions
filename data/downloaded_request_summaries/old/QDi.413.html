The armed group representative travelled to the Philippines to purchase arms for ISIL-aligned forces in Indonesia and to set up training courses for pro-ISIL recruits from Indonesia with ISIL’s network in the Philippines. After Isnilon Totoni Hapilon agreed to the plan, the recruits from Indonesia who eventually attended the terrorist training camps were trained in firearm use and basic bomb-making instructions.
