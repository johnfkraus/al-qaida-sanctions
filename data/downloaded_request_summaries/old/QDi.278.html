Al-Dari told the AQI member to tell new AQI recruits that they would be paid up to $10,000 upon completion of their training.

      Al-Dari has also provided operational guidance to AQI for attacks on civilian targets in Iraq. In mid-August 2008, Al-Dari attended training meetings conducted by AQI, during which he explained AQI's future intentions to trainees. Al-Dari told the trainees that changes were necessary in order to achieve greater attacks. Al-Dari also stated that if members receiving the training were unsuccessful, they would be replaced quickly with other AQI members. Al-Dari told trainees that all available support from AQI would be offered across Iraq for their operations. Al-Dari also advised the trainees that he and two other individuals would be traveling to Baghdad to begin re-supplying AQI leaders with equipment.
