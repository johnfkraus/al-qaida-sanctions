     <p>
      Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) emerged in Egypt in the early 1980s. In due course Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) became its leader.
     </p>
     <p>
      EIJ was responsible for the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. It also claimed responsibility for the attempted assassinations in 1993 of Interior Minister Hassan Al-Alfi and Prime Minister Atef Sedky. The group was responsible for bombing the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad in 1995 and plotted a similar attack against the US Embassy in Albania in 1998.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2001, EIJ joined forces with Usama bin Laden’s (deceased) Al-Qaida (QDe.004) network at Al-Zawahiri’s insistence. Objections from Tharwat Salah Shihata (QDi.017) and other members of the group led to a split in EIJ. Those who joined Al-Qaida included Al-Zawahiri, Nasr Fahmi Nasr Hassannein (deceased), Tariq Anwar el Sayed Ahmed (QDi.014) and Sobhi Abdel Aziz Mohamed el Gohary Abu Sinna (deceased). Shihata led the dissident group.
     </p>
     <p>
      EIJ has been active worldwide under the auspices of Al-Qaida. EIJ operatives played a key role in the attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001.
