      Yahia Djouadi, a.k.a. Yahia Abu Amar, was the leader of the Sahel-Sahara Zone of the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014) (AQIM), as well as the head of the Tarek ibn Ziad group, one of AQIM’s components in the Sahel-Sahara region, and had his support base in northern Mali.
      <br/>
      Since the announcement of their allegiance to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and through their new name “the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb”, the terrorist groups of this region have been attempting to consolidate their presence in the northern Sahel. With the aim of assisting Al-Qaida to achieve its objectives in the Maghreb and Sahel areas, AQIM has carried out several acts of terrorism in the region and claimed responsibility for the abduction of two Austrian tourists in southern Tunisia on 22 February 2008. The two Austrian tourists were taken to northern Mali, where Yahia Djouadi was active. Yahia Djouadi was reportedly killed in Mali in February 2022.
