He had been one of the organization\u2019s key paramilitary commanders in Afghanistan from the late 1990s and, between 2002 and 2004, was in charge of cross-border attacks in Afghanistan against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). He also directed plots to assassinate opponents of Al-Qaida, including Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and a United Nations official. Al-Baqi tried to return to his native country, Iraq, to manage Al-Qaida\u2019s affairs and possibly focus on operations outside Iraq against Western targets. Al-Baqi also met Al-Qaida members in Iran and believed that they should be doing more, including supporting Al-Qaida efforts in Iraq and causing problems within Iran. Al-Baqi provided leadership and reconnaissance support during a rocket attack in the fall of 2003 against United States military forces in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Al-Baqi was a former member of the Iraqi military who spent more than 15 years in Afghanistan. Before 11 September 2001, he was a member of Al-Qaida\u2019s ruling shura council as well as the group\u2019s military committee, which oversaw terrorist and guerrilla operations and paramilitary training. Al-Baqi had been a member of Al-Qaida since late 1990s, working as an instructor in one of Al-Qaida\u2019s training camps in Afghanistan. Al-Baqi was known and trusted by Usama bin Laden (deceased) and Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) and was in direct communication with both leaders, at one point serving as Al-Zawahiri\u2019s caretaker. Al-Baqi also interacted with other senior Al-Qaida planners and decision makers, such as Khalid Shaykh Muhammad and Abu Faraj al-Libi, listed as Ali Mohamed Abdul Aziz al Zar\u2019ani al Fakhiri (deceased), and Hamza Rabi\u2019a and Muhsin Moussa Matwalli Atwah Dewedar (deceased), prior to their deaths. Al-Baqi associated with leaders of other extremist groups allied with Al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including the Taliban. Al-Baqi worked directly with the Taliban to determine responsibilities and lines of communication between Taliban and Al-Qaida leaders in Afghanistan, specifically with regard to attacks on multinational forces.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

The attacks resulted in the deaths of more than 220 people and injured more than 4,000, as well as severely damaging or destroying the embassies and several other buildings.</p> <p>Between 1997 and August 1998, Ghailani, with the help of Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam (deceased) and another individual, purchased, in Arusha, Tanzania, the explosives, detonators and detonation cord used in the bombing. He transported them to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and later between storage locations in the city. Ghailani also obtained a cellular telephone and service, to facilitate communications for the group responsible for the Dar es Salaam bombing. Ghailani and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan (deceased) purchased the refrigeration truck used in the bombing and arranged for alterations to the truck to accommodate the bomb. Muhsin Moussa Matwalli Atwah Dewedar (deceased), the bomb engineer, supervised and assisted the bomb assembly in Dar es Salaam. Ghailani escorted Dewedar from Dar es Salaam to Kenya by bus and, in the process, surveyed the targeted site of the bombing. Ghailani also escorted the suicide driver for the bombing from Mombasa to Dar es Salaam and checked him into a hotel, as instructed by Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah el Alfi (QDi.019). Khalfan Khamis Mohammed, Swedan and Msalam met at Ghailani's residence, located in Dar es Salaam. In August 1998, Ghailani, Dewedar, Msalam, Abdullah, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed (deceased) and other co-conspirators met in Nairobi, Kenya. Ghailani then acted as a courier between Abdullah in Nairobi and Khalfan Khamis Mohammed in Dar es Salaam. On 1 August 1998, Abdullah advised all members of Al-Qaida to leave Kenya by 6 August 1998. Consequently, prior to the bombings, Ghailani received an airline ticket to Pakistan from Msalam, and, using a Tanzanian passport obtained under the alias Abubakar Khalfan Ahmed, traveled with Msalam, Swedan, and Abdullah from Nairobi to Karachi, Pakistan.</p> <p>After the bombings, between August and December 1998, Ghailani attended basic paramilitary training at Al-Qaida\u2019s Al-Farouq camp in Afghanistan, receiving instruction in the use of small arms and explosives, tactics, mountaineering, map reading, compass use and physical fitness. During the following four to five months, he joined a front-line Al-Qaida unit in Afghanistan fighting with the Taliban against the Northern Alliance. In 1999, Ghailani returned to the Al-Farouq camp, which had moved near Kabul, where he attended advanced explosives training for approximately one week. From 1999 to 2000, Ghailani served as a physical fitness trainer for more than one hundred Al-Qaida recruits at the camp and undertook training in advanced tactical small arms and explosives. Between 2000 and 2001, Ghailani served as an armed personal bodyguard and cook to Usama bin Laden (deceased). He fled to Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. From 2001 to July 2004, he forged travel documents for Al-Qaida operatives to be used in terrorist attacks. During this time he worked for Abu Hamza Rabia, Al-Qaida\u2019s chief of external operations, and met many high and low level Al-Qaida operatives. In May 2004, Ghailani conspired with Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah and others to commit terrorist attacks during the 4 July 2004 United States Independence Day celebrations and the Presidential elections in the United States.</p> <p>Ghailani was detained in Pakistan on 24 July 2004 and turned over to the United States authorities. In 2009, he was transferred to New York, United States, where he remained detained as of October 2010 and stood charged with, among other crimes, conspiring with Usama bin Laden and others to kill United States nationals, both in the United States and abroad, including by bombing the United States Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Haramayn Foundation (Kenya) (QDe.105), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Sayf-al Adl (QDi.001), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah el Alfi (QDi.019), listed on 17 October 2001</p> <p>Khalid Abd al-Rahman Hamd al-Fawaz (QDi.059), listed on 24 April 2002</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar in a loosely knit plot to attack United States targets in Jordan.</p> <p>When Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed in late 1996, Hijazi moved to the United States. He worked as a cabdriver in Boston and sent money back to his fellow militants. After Abu Hoshar\u2019s release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan, gathering money and supplies for the planned attacks. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited militants in Turkey, Syria and Jordan.\u00a0 With an Al-Qaida leader's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.</p> <p>In late 1998, Hijazi and Abu Hoshar developed a more detailed plan to attack targets in Jordan. They planned to attack four targets: the SAS Radisson Hotel in downtown Amman, the border crossings from Jordan to Israel, and two Christian holy sites, at a time when these locations were likely to be frequented by tourists. Next, they planned to attack a local airport and other religious and cultural sites. Hijazi and Abu Hoshar surveyed the intended targets and sent reports to an Al-Qaida leader, who approved their plan. Once back in Amman from Boston, Hijazi gradually accumulated materials for the bombs, including sulfuric acid and 5,200 pounds of nitric acid, which were stored under a rented house in a sub-basement dug by the plotters over a period of two months.</p> <p>In early 1999, Hijazi and Abu Hoshar contacted Khalil Deek, an Al-Qaida associate who lived in Peshawar, Pakistan. With Afghanistan-based extremists, Deek had created an electronic terrorist manual, \u201cEncyclopedia of Jihad\u201d, and he gave Hijazi and Abu Hoshar a CD-ROM copy.\u00a0 In June 1999, with help from Deek, Abu Hoshar arranged with an Al-Qaida leader for Hijazi and three others to go to Afghanistan for additional training in handling explosives. In late November 1999, Hijazi reportedly swore before an Al-Qaida leader\u00a0to follow orders from Usama bin Laden (deceased). He was in Syria, on his way back to Jordan, when the\u00a0Al-Qaida\u00a0sent Abu Hoshar a message that prompted Jordanian authorities to arrest him and 15 other militants, including Hijazi, and disband the cell. After the arrest, the Jordanian authorities searched the cell\u2019s premises in Amman and found 71 drums of acids, several forged Saudi passports, detonators, and Deek\u2019s Encyclopedia.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>\u00a0</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Abu Qatada al-Filistini has been involved in terrorism-related activity since at least 1995 and has been described as the \u201cspiritual ambassador in Europe to Usama bin Laden\u201d (deceased). He is a significant international terrorism figure and a leading advisor with extensive links to, and influence over, Al-Qaida-related (QDe.004) groups in the United Kingdom and other countries, including the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) (QDe.006), the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), listed as the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014) and Al-Jihad/Egyptian Islamic Movement, listed as Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003). He has engaged in conduct which facilitates and gives encouragement to the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. He has conducted such facilitation by personal contact, telephone, letters and the Internet.\u00a0 He also raised funds for Al-Qaida-related terrorist groups.</p> <p>Omar Mahmoud Uthman has significant and long standing connections with terrorist organizations operating in Algeria: the GIA and the GSPC. He was an adviser to the GIA until 1996 and saw himself as the group\u2019s representative in London. He allied himself to the more violent elements of the organization, and it is reported that he told a newspaper in 1995 that the killing of foreigners in Algeria was justified because they held entry visas issued by an illegal regime. He sent money to the GIA from London.</p> <p>Omar Mahmoud Uthman provided financial assistance to Bin Laden\u2019s associates in Amman, Jordan. He was twice convicted in absentia in Jordan for involvement in terrorist attacks there in March and April 1998 and in relation to a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. He faced a 15-year prison term.</p> <p>Omar Mahmoud Uthman has long-established connections with Usama bin Laden and Al- Qaida, and has maintained close contacts with London-based Al-Qaida associates. He was in close contact with Khalid Abd al-Rahman Hamd al-Fawaz (QDi.059) who was Bin Laden\u2019s representative in the United Kingdom prior to Al-Fawaz\u2019s arrest in the United Kingdom in 1998. In 1998, it was reported that Omar Mahmoud Uthman had in the past received funding directly from Bin Laden. He has repeatedly associated himself with and expressed his support for him, in particular in a television broadcast in January 2000 and in an interview in December 2001. He also has links with Al-Jihad/Egyptian Islamic Movement through Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006).</p> <p>In the late 1990s, he became a mentor and provided financial support to the GSPC, as well as became an adviser to Moroccan, Tunisian and Libyan extremist groups. He was also a significant counselor to the Al-Tawhid movement, listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115 ), whose leader was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, also known as Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased).</p> <p>In 1997, it was reported that he was actively recruiting for Afghan training camps. In the period 1999-2001 he played a leading role in the United Kingdom in raising funds and providing logistic support and recruits for fighters in Chechnya.</p> <p>In February 2001, he was arrested by anti-terrorism police officers in the United Kingdom because he was suspected of involvement with the Abu Doha terrorist cell in Frankfurt which had been responsible for plotting to cause explosions at the Christmas market in Strasbourg, France. United Kingdom and foreign currency with a value in excess of \u00a3170,000 was found in his possession. \u00a3805 was found attached to a note indicating that it was bound for fighters in Chechnya. This money was collected from supporters around Europe and was destined for both legitimate causes and illegal causes, including funding for training camps and international terrorist and violent groups in places like Jordan and Chechnya. Omar Mahmoud Uthman was responsible for the safekeeping and distribution of this money. There is also evidence that he was involved in funding individuals involved in violent activities in Indonesia.</p> <p>In January 2002, it was reported that persons attending the Fatimah Center mosque in London, United Kingdom, believed that he was responsible for organizing trips to Afghanistan for military training. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission of the United Kingdom (SIAC) concurred that he encouraged and raised funds for individuals to go to Afghanistan and considered as probably correct that he had links with Ansar al-Islam (QDe.098), that he had given them money and had suggested to them that they should seek more support from Al-Qaida.</p> <p>Omar Mahmoud Uthman was deported to Jordan from the United Kingdom on 7 July 2013 to face terrorism charges.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003), listed on 6 Oct. 2001</p> <p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Ansar Al-Islam (QDe.098), listed on 24 February. 2003</p> <p>Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115 ), listed on 18 October 2004.</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Khalid Abd al-Rahman Hamd al-Fawaz (QDi.059), listed on 24 April 2002</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Bin Laden devoted substantial funds towards the establishment of an AIAI-administered government in Somalia with the aim of setting up an Al-Qaida base of operations there. In return, AIAI later supported Al-Qaida in perpetrating the 7 August 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>Since 1996, still under the leadership of Aweys, AIAI has been involved in several attacks: the shooting of two Ethiopian businessmen in Somalia; several bombings in Ethiopia, including an attack against a hotel in Addis Ababa that killed four people and injured 20; and assassinations and attempted assassinations of Ethiopian cabinet ministers. After Al-Qaida\u2019s attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, AIAI became decentralized and dispersed in order to avoid being targeted by counter-terrorism operations. Aweys has continued to pursue his AIAI-related goals.</p> <p>In 2006, Aweys was appointed to a senior leadership position in the Council of Islamic Courts. He used his position to contest the transitional government in Somalia. In December 2006, following the Ethiopian-backed military intervention in Somalia, Aweys moved to Asmara, Eritrea, where he continued to act in line with the goals of AIAI, including by instigating and raising funds and arms for the Al-Qaida-affiliated insurgency and terrorist attacks in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya. He sought a prominent national role and traveled internationally to raise support for his cause. Aweys rejected the United Nations-supported talks that led to the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Somalia and the formation of the new Somali government (TFG) under President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. He subsequently refused to negotiate a cease-fire and, instead, directed his faction to continue the insurgency against the Government and African Union peacekeeping forces in Somalia (AMISOM), in cooperation with the Hizbul Islam coalition.\u00a0 On 26 May 2009, Aweys was named chairman of Hizbul Islam, an alliance of four armed groups which continued to pose a persistent threat to the peace, security and stability of Somalia and conduct sustained military operations against TFG and AMISOM.</p> <p>In 2009, Aweys returned to Mogadishu and his forces attempted - and failed - to take power by force from TFG, in cooperation with Harakaat al-Shabaab al-Mujahidiin, which supports Al-Qaida. In September 2009, Aweys strongly condemned a foreign military operation that led to the death of Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a high-level Al-Qaida leader involved in high-profile attacks in the region in the 1990s and 2000s, and called on his followers to launch more suicide attacks in response. Thus, over the past decades, Aweys has consistently promulgated Al-Qaida-aligned policies and advocated and resorted to violence in pursuing those goals.</p> <p>During Aweys leadership, AIAI established ideological, financial, and training links with Al-Qaida, and fostered contacts with Al-Qaida-associated entities in North Africa and the Middle East, including Algeria's Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006); Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003); the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014); the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (QDe.011); Islamic Army of Aden (QDe.009); the International Islamic Relief Organization (some offices are listed on the Al-Qaida Sanctions List); and Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (QDe.070). Several AIAI operatives and leaders trained and fought with Al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and continue to provide support and protection to Al-Qaida cells in Somalia.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Islamic Army of Aden (QDe.009), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (QDe.011 ), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (QDe.070), listed on 11 January 2002</p> <p>Al-Haramayn Foundation (Kenya) (QDe.105), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania) (QDe.106), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Ethiopia Branch (QDe.113), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>\u00a0</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

But he failed to do so because his visa application was denied by the authorities of the United States.</p> <p>After his efforts to enter the United States had failed, Binalshibh took on the role of a coordinator particularly with regard to communication between the various people involved in the preparation of the attacks. Moreover, he gave logistical support for the financing of the plot. In July and September 2000, Binalshibh sent from Germany, through two bank transfers, approximately 14,000 DM to Alshehhi in the United States in preparation for the attacks.</p> <p>In December 2000, Ramzi Binalshibh met Zacarias Moussaoui in London, who, some time later, began flight training in the United States. Zacarias Moussaoui was later arrested and charged in the United States for his involvement in preparations for the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.</p> <p>At the beginning of January 2001, Atta informed Ramzi Binalshibh in Berlin of the status of the preparations for the attacks in the United States.

He left Germany on 22 May 2000 and returned on 1 August 2000, during which time he received military training in Afghanistan at a camp near Kandahar.</p> <p>During the absence of the other members, Mounir el Motassadeq and Bahaji acted as leaders of the terrorist organization in Hamburg sharing the tasks of those who were absent and cooperating closely. Mounir el Motassadeq played a significant role in financing the organization\u2019s terrorist activities. This mainly involved having access to Alshehhi\u2019s account, which served as the financial source. Mounir el Motassadeq ensured that the account was credited with student grants by transferring Alshehhi\u2019s semester fees. Fully aware of purposes to which the money was to be put, Mounir el Motassadeq transferred money from Alshehhi\u2019s account to the account of Binalshibh, which Binalshibh passed on to Alshehhi in the United States to finance his flight training. Mounir el Motassadeq also used Alshehhi\u2019s account to fund Binalshibh\u2019s and Essabar\u2019s planned flight training as well as to benefit other members of organization. So as not to endanger the preparations for the attacks, Mounir el Motassadeq concealed, in January 2001, the whereabouts of Marwan Alshehhi when officials of the United Arab Emirates and Alshehhi\u2019s brother were looking for him in Hamburg.</p> <p>Mounir el Motassadeq was arrested on 28 November 2001, accused of murder and offences constituting a danger to public safety by the authorities of Germany.

For this reason, he made two applications, on 12 December 2000 and on 28 January 2001, for a residence visa for the United States of America; both were rejected. On 30 August 2001, by agreement with Binalshibh and Bahaji, Zakarya Essabar went to an Al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The authorities of Germany issued an arrest warrant for Zakarya Essabar on 18 October 2001 charging him, amongst other things, with murder and manslaughter.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Said Bahaji (QDi.080), listed on 30 September 2002</p> <p>Ramzi Mohamed Abdullah Binalshibh (QDi.081), listed on 30 September 2002</p> <p>Mounir el Motassadeq (QDi.082), listed on 30 September 2002</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Isamuddin met JI founders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.217) in Indonesia in the 1980s prior to traveling to Afghanistan, where he trained at Rasul Sayyaf's Sada camp and fought alongside and had contact with several Al-Qaida leaders, including Usama bin Laden (deceased) and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. After returning to Indonesia in the early 1990s, Isamuddin further strengthened his association with Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir, Abdullah Sungkar and Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman (QDi.086).</p> <p>Isamuddin was the head of JI\u2019s regional \u201cshura\u201d, a policy-making body of the organization. He was also considered JI\u2019s director of operations, which oversaw JI\u2019s financing, and served as the primary interface with Al-Qaida. He was Al-Qaida\u2019s operations director for the Southeast Asia region.</p> <p>Isamuddin was involved in the 1995 \u201cOperation Bojinka\u201d plot to bomb 11 United States commercial airliners in Asia and directed the late 2001 foiled plot to attack foreign targets in Singapore.</p> <p>In 1999, Isamuddin arranged for a JI courier to deliver a surveillance videotape of a potential bombing target in Singapore to Al-Qaida member Sobhi Abdel Aziz Mohamed el Gohary Abu Sinna (deceased), also known as Mohamed Atef and as Abu Hafs al Masri, one of Usama bin Laden\u2019s lieutenants in Afghanistan. Abu Sinna\u2019s instructions to procure explosives and to short-list men to execute the attack were brought back by the courier to Isamuddin, who made arrangements for JI members to train in Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. Following the first arrests of JI members by the Singapore authorities in December 2001, Isamuddin met and urged some JI members to persist in their terrorist plans, which included a plot to attack simultaneously six locations in Singapore with truck bombs.</p> <p>In addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with Al-Qaida, Isamuddin and JI assisted Al-Qaida operatives passing through Kuala Lumpur. Between December 1999 and January 2000 Isamuddin helped several veterans who had just finished training in Karachi, Pakistan, including Tawfiq bin Attash, also known as Khallad, to facilitate the USS Cole bombing. Isamuddin was videotaped in a January 2000 Al-Qaida meeting with two of the 11 September 2001 hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al\u2011Hazmi.</p> <p>Isamuddin also was involved in planning a series of bombings in Manila, the Philippines, that killed 22 people and injured more than 100 on 30 December 2000. One JI member admitted to Philippines investigators that Isamuddin was also involved in the bombing of the residence of the Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia on 1 August 2000, which killed two people and seriously injured the Ambassador. In addition, Isamuddin was involved in a series of coordinated bombings of churches in Jakarta and eight other cities on 24 December 2000, killing 18 people and injuring many others.</p> <p>Isamuddin helped Abu Sinna find a scientist for Al-Qaida to take over its biological weapons program by introducing a JI member, Yazid Sufaat (QDi.124), to Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In 2001, Sufaat spent several months attempting to cultivate anthrax for Al-Qaida in a laboratory he helped set up near Kandahar airport.</p> <p>Isamuddin helped Noordin Mohammad Top (deceased) execute the 12\u00a0October 2002 Bali attack that killed 202 people and injured 209, and the 5 August 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p> <p>Isamuddin and his younger brother, Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan (QDi.218), established and led a foreign student organization in Pakistan called Al-Ghuraba, which was linked to Al-Qaida and the Taliban. The Al-Ghuraba group was formed to groom the next generation of JI leaders, provide them with training in weapons and explosives, and give them firsthand experience in militant operations. The group also served as a JI sleeper cell. Al-Ghuraba cell members were instructed on suicide and hijacking operations.</p> <p>Isamuddin was sought by authorities in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. He was arrested in Thailand in August 2003 and was in custody of the United States of America as of July 2007.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman (QDi.086), listed on 28 January 2003</p> <p>Yazid Sufaat (QDi.124), listed on 9 September 2003</p> <p>Abu Rusdan (QDi.186), listed on 16 May 2005</p> <p>Aris Sumarsono (QDi.187), listed on 16 May 2005</p> <p>Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.217), listed on 21 April 2006</p> <p>Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan (QDi.218), listed on 21 April 2006</p> <p>Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.293), listed on 19 July 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

The \u201cAl-Tawhid\u201d organization had close personal and organizational links to the Al-Qaida (QDe.004) network. Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), a.k.a. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was the operational leader of the organization. Its main goals included securing a base of operations in Iraq from which it could launch terrorist attacks. The organization was responsible for the kidnapping and subsequent murder of civilians and the bombing of civilian targets, including the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003.</p> <p>By September 2001, an independent \u201cAl-Tawhid\u201d cell had formed in Germany. The cell worked in an insular and clandestine manner, mostly operating independently within the scope of directives from leaders abroad. It was an integral part of an international network which, among other things, ensured that Al-Qaida in Iraq received logistical and financial support.</p> <p>The cell\u2019s activities in Germany consisted mainly of forging passports, collecting donations and facilitating the illegal cross-border travel of persons linked to the \u201cAl-Tawhid\u201d organization. However, there were also strong indications that, under the direction of Al-Zarqawi, the cell was planning to commit attacks in Germany. The plan was to use a pistol fitted with a silencer and a crate of hand grenades to carry out an attack on a busy square in a German town or city and to detonate hand grenades in another German town in the immediate vicinity of Israeli or Jewish property with the aim of killing as many people as possible. The attacks were supposed to be carried out by Ismail Shalabi together with other members of the cell. The perpetrators targeted a Jewish community building in Berlin which they erroneously took to be a Jewish museum, and a bar and a discoth\u00e8que in D\u00fcsseldorf which they deemed, also by mistake, to be run or frequented by Jewish people.</p> <p>Djamel Moustfa, who used the name \u201cMustafa\u201d when he communicated with the organization and was known in the group as a passport forger and gun runner. He not only knew about the terrorist objectives of the group but supported them.</p> <p>From autumn 2001 until his arrest on 23 April 2002, Moustfa had an important role in the passport forgery and procurement activities of the group. Other members of the group used him to gain access to presumably forged passports in return for payment. Unidentified couriers were supposed to transport the passports to members of the organization still in Iran so that they could travel to safe third countries. A member of the group used his contacts with Moustfa to procure telephone cards for clandestine purposes.</p> <p>In March and April 2002, Djamel Moustfa, acting on instructions, tried to procure at least one handgun with a silencer for the group through contacts in Essen and Hamburg. In addition, he declared his willingness to obtain suitable ammunition and numerous hand grenades. These weapons were to be used in a possible future attack. He knew these weapons were intended for a possible future attack by the group in Germany.</p> <p>On 26 October 2005, Djamel Moustfa was convicted in Germany of supporting a terrorist group and was sentenced to five years in jail. Three other individuals were convicted of plotting attacks and belonging to a terrorist organization. They were sentenced to up to eight years of imprisonment.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), listed on 18 October 2004</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

He assumed leadership of GSPC in mid-2004.<br/> As an explosives expert for the Armed Islamic Group, a.k.a. GIA (QDe.006), Droukdel built explosive devices that killed hundreds of civilians in attacks perpetrated in public areas.<br/> In a statement dated 13 September 2006, Droukdel announced the official alliance of GSPC with Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and pledged allegiance to Usama bin Laden (deceased). In a statement dated 24 January 2007, he announced that as a consequence of its merging with Al-Qaida, and after consulting Usama bin Laden, GSPC changed its name to the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. In a July 2008 interview with the New York Times, Droukdel again claimed responsibility for having GSPC officially join Al-Qaida and acknowledged the role played by Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh a.k.a. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (deceased) in the first phases of the merging process.<br/> Under Droukdel\u2019s leadership, AQIM carried out a series of terrorist attacks, such as the October 2006 car-bomb attacks on the Dergana and Reghaia police stations in the eastern suburbs of Algiers, the attack on a bus carrying expatriate employees of the Algerian-American \u201cBrown &amp; Root Condor\u201d oil company near Bouchaoui on 10 December 2006, the attack on a convoy of the Russian Stroy Transgaz company on 3 March 2007, and the seven car-bomb attacks on security installations in the Boumerdes and Tizi-Ouzou wilayat (regions) on 13 February 2007.<br/> Droukdel also supervised the terrorist attacks against the Government palace and the office of the criminal investigation department of the police in Algiers, Algeria that took place on Wednesday, 11 April 2007. These car bombings killed 33 persons and wounded 245 others, the majority of whom were passers-by and neighborhood residents.<br/> A few hours after the attacks, AQIM broadcast a videotape on Internet sites and on television networks, claiming responsibility for these suicide bombings. They provoked unanimous condemnation inside and outside Algeria, including from the United Nations Security Council which issued a presidential statement condemning these attacks in the strongest terms (S/PRST/2007/10 of 12 April 2007).<br/> AQIM claimed responsibility for the 11 December 2007 attacks against the United Nations offices and the Constitutional Court building in Algiers in a statement issued on the same day. The United Nations Security Council immediately condemned the operations in the strongest terms (S/PRST/2007/45 of 11 December 2007). In his July 2008 interview with the New York Times, Droukdel again claimed responsibility for these bombings.<br/> In August 2008, Droukdel directed the execution of three suicide-attacks that killed many civilians in the wilayat (regions) of Boumerdes, Bouira and Tizi Ouzou, Algeria.<br/> Droukdel encouraged AQIM to kidnap Algerian and foreign nationals as a way to fund its terrorist activities. The group was involved in holding two Austrian tourists abducted in February 2008 in southern Tunisia, in holding two United Nations representatives abducted in northern Niger in December 2008, and in holding four European tourists abducted in the border area between Mali and Niger in January 2009.<br/> Droukdel was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia by the tribunal of Tizi-Ouzou, Algeria, on 27 March 2007 for his involvement in Al-Qaida-related terrorist activities.<br/> In October 2011, Abdelmalek Droukdel wanted cover to expand the agenda of his terrorist organization into the Sahel and increase its territorial control over northern Mali. AQIM wanted to create an ostensibly independent movement that would hide its true roots by abandoning the name \u201cAl-Qaida\u201d. AQIM suggested that the new group be led by Iyad ag Ghali (QDi.316). Since its establishment, Ansar Eddine (QDe.135) and its leader, Iyad ag Ghali, have enjoyed AQIM\u2019s continual support:<br/> \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Military support: from the battle at Aguelhok on 24 January 2012 to the offensive in early January 2013 against southern Mali, Ansar Eddine received backing from AQIM in its fight against the Malian Armed Forces, notably in the capture of the towns of Aguelhok on 24 January 2012; Tessalit on 10 March 2012; Kidal on 30 March 2012; Gao on 30 March 2012; and Timbuktu on 1 April 2012.<br/> \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Financial support: Iyad ag Ghali received a payment of 400,000 euros from one<br/> of the leaders of an AQIM brigade in the Sahel, the Tariq ibn Ziyad Brigade.<br/> \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Logistical support: originally comprising some 50 men close to Iyad ag Ghali,<br/> Ansar Eddine has welcomed numerous AQIM fighters.<br/> The ties between Ansar Eddine and AQIM have grown stronger since November 2012.<br/> In November 2012, an alliance was concluded between AQIM, Ansar Eddine, and MUJAO. Offices were established north of Gao by a mission combining AQIM, Ansar Eddine and MUJAO and a common strategy was defined.<br/> On 25 November 2012, Iyad ag Ghali expressed his support for AQIM\u2019s ideology.<br/> Since the start of Operation Serval, Iyad ag Ghali has aligned himself with AQIM and MUJAO brigades that are fighting the French and Malian armed forces.<br/> Abdelmalek Droukdel was reportedly killed on 3 June 2020.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Mouvement pour l\u2019Unification et le Jihad en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest (MUJAO) (QDe.134), listed on 5 December 2012</p> <p>Ansar Eddine (QDe.135), listed on 20 March 2013</p> <p>Al Mourabitoun (QDe.141), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Mokhtar Belmokhtar (QDi.136), listed on 11 November 2003</p> <p>Saifi Ammari (QDi.152), listed on 4 December 2003</p> <p>Ahmed Deghdegh (QDi.252), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Yahia Djouadi (QDi.249), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Salah Eddine Gasmi (QDi.251), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Amor Mohamed Ghedeir (QDi.250), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Djamel Akkacha (QDi.313), listed on 5 February 2013</p> <p>Iyad ag Ghali (QDi.316) listed on 25 February 2013</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Al-Ali provided financial support for these recruits, including paying their travel expenses to Iraq. Al-Ali obtained much of this money from collections in his mosque.

He actively recruited members of the organization and succeeded in raising funds for various RSM projects, including from an organization linked to Mohammad Jamal Khalifa, a brother-in-law of Usama bin Laden (deceased). He also acquired skills in the manufacture of bombs and improvised explosive devices.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>After founding the RSM in January 2002, he permitted and even directed its members to be deployed by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) (QDe.001) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092) as bombers or in support roles. Santos has been involved in the planning of bombing attacks against Philippines and non-Philippines civilians and in the stockpiling of weapons to conduct such operations.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>In May 2002, he was directed by JI operative Fathur Rohman al-Ghozhi (deceased) to launch terrorist attacks in Metro Manila to support the terrorist activities of JI and the ASG. The RSM members tasked by Santos to launch the attacks were arrested by Philippines security forces before they were able to execute their plans.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Santos recruited Angelo Ramirez Trinidad (QDi.241) to the RSM in 2002 and subsequently instructed him to undergo a demolition and explosives training course in 2004 conducted by JI in camp Jabal Quba. Santos himself attended training courses on explosives which were facilitated by JI in Liguasan Marsh, Maguindanao. One of his instructors was Joko Pitono a.k.a. Dulmatin (deceased).</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Santos was responsible for planning operation \u201cBig Bang\u201d, which was foiled by Philippines authorities in 2005. The concept of the operation was to target the Embassy of the United States of America and business establishments in Ermita, Manila, which were frequented by foreigners, particularly Americans, with a vehicle rigged with explosives. The attack was planned by the RSM, on behalf of JI and the ASG, at a meeting presided over by Santos in August 2004 in Baranguay Dita, Sta Rosa, Laguna. Santos selected the RSM members that were to execute the plan. Upon instructions from Santos, an RSM operative, Ricardo Perez Ayeras (QDi.248), rented a car and used it to transport explosives acquired from illegal explosives manufacturers in Bulacan to a safe house in Pasig City, and then to Fairview, Quezon City. In March 2005, the Philippines authorities recovered 650 kilograms of explosives and components for improvised explosive devices from an apartment rented by the RSM in Lilac Street, Fairview, Quezon City. RSM member Pio Abogne De Vera (QDi.245) admitted that the material was for operation \u201cBig Bang\u201d.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Santos was subsequently arrested in 2005 for illegal possession of explosives and also charged for rebellion. He has also been charged in connection to an ASG kidnapping for ransom case.

He took over as RSM\u2019s political, religious and strategic leader following the arrest of Hilarion Del Rosario Santos III a.k.a. Ahmad Islam Santos (QDi.244) in 2005. He is considered RSM\u2019s spiritual advisor.</p> <p>Ruben Lavilla, Jr. was a classmate of Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani (deceased), the head of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) (QDe.001), at the Darul Islam Al Shafie Academy (now known as Ibno Shinah Integrated School) in Marawi City in 1992. This school was established in 1989 by an organization linked to Mohammad Jamal Khalifa, a brother-in-law of Usama bin Laden (deceased). He attended training on military tactics and explosives, including bomb making, conducted by the ASG and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092) in Mindanao. ASG leaders Khadafi Janjalani (deceased) and Jainal Antel Sali, Jr. (deceased) were among his mentors.</p> <p>Lavilla actively solicited donations for the RSM and other similar organizations in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, which he then sent to the Philippines. During a police raid of an RSM training camp in Anda, Pangasinan, the Philippines, in 2002, Lavilla escaped arrest because he was in Mindanao to pick up funds promised to the RSM by Khadafi Janjalani (deceased). At some point before 2003, Lavilla personally couriered approximately 200,000 USD for the RSM.</p> <p>Lavilla recruited members of the RSM. He later sent them to be trained by the ASG and JI in Mindanao.</p> <p>Lavilla was implicated in a bombing at the Awang Airport near Cotabato City on 20 February 2003 that killed one soldier and wounded three civilians. JI and the ASG were behind this attack. Lavilla was also a part of an ASG-sponsored cell that carried out the bombing of a passenger ferry in Manila Bay in February 2004 that killed over 100 people.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Rajah Solaiman Movement (QDe.128), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Angelo Ramirez Trinidad (QDi.241), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Dinno Amor Rosalejos Pareja (QDi.242), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Feliciano Semborio Delos Reyes Jr. (QDi.243), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Hilarion Del Rosario Santos III (QDi.244), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Pio Abogne De Vera (QDi.245), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Redendo Cain Dellosa (QDi.246), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Ricardo Perez Ayeras (QDi.248), listed on 4 June 2008</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Ayeras and De Vera transported the explosives, bought from factories in Bulacan, to a house in Pasig City. The materials were subsequently transferred to a rented apartment in Fairview, Quezon City.

Furthermore, the group procured the additional means needed for carrying out the attacks - such as, for instance, electrical devices for triggering the detonation - as well as several detonators.

In 2000, an international warrant was issued for his arrest.</p> <p>The Kavkazcenter has been proclaimed the official information organ of the Emarat Kavkaz by Doku Umarov. Publications on the website are in Russian, English, Arabic, Turkish and Ukrainian. The main address is <em>Kavkazcenter.com</em>. The additional web portals are <em>Kavkazcenter.info</em>, <em>Kavkazcenter.net</em>, <em>Kavkaz.org.uk</em> and <em>Kavkaz.tv</em>. The principal internet provider of the website is located in Stockholm, Sweden. In March 2008 it published \u201cConcept of the Islamic State\u201d. Since 2007 the website has regularly published videos in which Doku Umarov and the heads of the Emarat Kavkaz have taken personal responsibility for terrorist acts carried out on the territory of Russia including the one at the Domodedovo airport (Moscow) on 24 January 2011.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs (RSRSBCM) (QDe.100), listed on 4 March 2003</p> <p>Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119), listed on 1 June 2005</p> <p>Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131), listed on 29 July 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

In 2006 Al-Asiri was arrested by the Saudi police and imprisoned for nine months for trying to enter Iraq to join a militant group there. Upon his release, Al-Asiri attempted to create a new militant cell inside Saudi Arabia; however, police raided its meeting place and six of his colleagues were killed while he and his brother Abdullah fled to Yemen. Soon afterwards, Al-Asiri joined AQAP and has continued to engage in terrorist activity.</p> <p>Al-Asiri encouraged his brother Abdullah to participate in AQAP activity. In August 2009, Abdullah carried out a suicide attack when he detonated a bomb concealed within his body with the intent to assassinate the Assistant Minister for Security Affairs of Saudi Arabia. Although the assassination attempt failed, the plot demonstrated a high level of sophistication on the part of AQAP. Ibrahim al-Asiri is credited with designing the bomb, which contained one pound of explosives. Later, AQAP released a video of Ibrahim al-Asiri and his brother Abdullah in which an AQAP commander stated that Ibrahim al-Asiri had also wanted to perpetrate a suicide attack but had to be kept behind to oversee the mission of Abdullah.</p> <p>A Saudi Arabian citizen, in 2009 Al-Asiri was added to the Saudi most wanted terrorist list, and an INTERPOL Orange Notice was distributed worldwide.

He is the son of Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.217), one of the co-founders of JI. In 2005, Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir was selected as the leader of JI\u2019s administrative region (wakalah) in central Java, Indonesia. As such, he was responsible for overseeing JI cells and had full knowledge of certain JI operations in Indonesia in 2005 and 2006. He maintained close relations with clandestine elements of JI in 2007. As of mid-2009, he was regarded as a senior JI leader with the ability to instigate violence.</p> <p>Outside Southeast Asia, Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir served from the late 1990s to 2002 as a leader of JI\u2019s Al-Ghuraba cell in Karachi, Pakistan. A smaller organization modeled after JI, Al-Ghuraba was formed with the approval of Al-Qaida and JI leader Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin (QDi.087), also known as Hambali, to groom the next generation of JI leaders, provide them with training in weapons and explosives, and give them firsthand experience in militant operations. Hambali also planned to make Al-Ghuraba a cover entity to support the travel of JI operatives going to Afghanistan for Al-Qaida training. Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir was appointed by Hambali to lead JI\u2019s Al-Ghuraba cell because Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir was a recognized figure within JI and Al-Qaida. As the Al-Ghuraba leader, he indoctrinated students to become future JI leaders and instructed that Al-Ghuraba cell members should kill westerners at every opportunity. He also taught them how to carry out a hijacking operation.</p> <p>While in Pakistan and Afghanistan from the late 1990s to mid-2002, Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir served as JI\u2019s main contact with Al-Qaida and played a key facilitation role for Al-Qaida. He swore an oath of loyalty to Usama bin Laden (deceased) and provided logistical, communications, and media support to Al-Qaida in several instances. He also served as an Al-Qaida conduit for fighters in Pakistan and as an intermediary between Hambali and Al-Qaida, relaying messages between them.</p> <p>Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir was one of several Al-Qaida members who controlled an Al-Qaida media center in Afghanistan and directed its activities. The media center produced videos and photos for Al-Qaida propaganda. He was also present at a meeting of selected 9/11 hijackers in Afghanistan in May 2001 and likely participated in making the videos of their last wills and testaments. Upon returning to Indonesia in 2002, he continued to provide support for Al-Qaida. As of early 2004, he was reportedly Al-Qaida\u2019s only contact in Southeast Asia. He regularly passed information to a senior Al-Qaida operative known as Abu Talha until at least mid-2004.</p> <p>Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir has also been involved in JI's outreach to the Pakistan-based terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET) (QDe.118). Sometime after 1999, he was tasked by JI member Aris Sumarsono (QDi.187) to run a madrassa in Pakistan and was encouraged to expand cooperation between JI and LET through this madrassa.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p>Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin (QDi.087), listed on 28 January 2003</p> <p>Abu Rusdan (QDi.186), listed on 16 May 2005</p> <p>Aris Sumarsono (QDi.187), listed on 16 May 2005</p> <p>Abu Bakar Ba'asyir (QDi.217), listed on 21 April 2006</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

A few weeks before the blasts, Patek attended a meeting in Solo, central Java, Indonesia, where participants, including JI leaders Joko Pitono (deceased), also known as Dulmatin, Imam Samudra (deceased) and Mukhlis, who is also deceased, agreed to execute the Bali bombings. Patek was personally involved in assembling the van bomb and explosives used in the Bali attack.</p> <p>As of early 2006, Patek had built bombs for ASG using 60 mm mortar bombs. As of mid-2007, Patek and Dulmatin were teaching ASG members bomb-making techniques to include training in improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The IEDs were intended to block Armed Forces of the Philippines troops who might be in pursuit of JI and ASG. In January 2011, Patek was arrested in Abbotabad, Pakistan, and repatriated seven months later to Indonesia. In June 2012, Patek was convicted for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In May 2015, remained in custody in Indonesia.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001), listed on 6 October 2001<br/> Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002<br/> Rajah Solaiman Movement (QDe.128), listed on 4 June 2008<br/> Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin (QDi.087), listed on 28 January 2003<br/> Abu Rusdan (QDi.186), listed on 16 May 2005<br/> Isnilon Totoni Hapilon (QDi.204), listed on 6 December 2005<br/> Abu Bakar Ba'asyir (QDi.217), listed on 21 April 2006<br/> Pio Abogne De Vera (QDi.245), listed on 4 June 2008<br/> Ricardo Perez Ayeras (QDi.248), listed on 4 June 2008</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

He is the son of Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman (QDi.086). Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman was sentenced in Indonesia to five years in jail on 29 June 2010 for concealing information about terrorist crimes in connection with attacks in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 17 July 2009, and for falsifying documents. On 17 July 2009, two suicide bombers detonated explosive devices at the J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in Jakarta, killing seven people and wounding approximately 50 others.</p> <p>Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman has solicited funds on behalf of senior JI member Noordin Mohammad Top (deceased), who led the JI faction that conducted the group's 17 July 2009 attacks. In August 2008, Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman agreed to provide Top with funding for terrorist operations at a meeting with Top and Saefudin Zuhri, the main plotter of the 17 July 2009 bombings who is also deceased. Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman contacted his Saudi-based brother to request that he arrange for approximately $10,000 in cash to be passed to Top. A letter found on Top\u2019s laptop written by Zuhri identified Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman as the connection between Top\u2019s network and foreigners providing funding. Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman also personally went to Saudi Arabia in September 2008 to raise funds for terrorist attacks.</p> <p>As of late 2008, Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman was working on behalf of JI member Imam Samudra (deceased) and other JI members responsible for bombings in Indonesia. Samudra was executed on 9 November 2008 in Indonesia for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people.</p> <p>Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman was a senior member of JI\u2019s Pakistan-based Al-Ghuraba cell and had been selected by JI leaders for travel to Pakistan as a member of that cell. While in Pakistan, he participated in military training and, in 2001 was dispatched to Kashmir by JI member and Al-Ghuraba cell leader Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan (QDi.218). Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman returned to Pakistan in 2007, where he met with Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and Taliban personnel. Jibril\u2019s contact with Al-Qaida shows his intention to obtain support from Al-Qaida and to advance Al-Qaida\u2019s objectives.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman (QDi.086), listed on 28 January 2003</p> <p>Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan (QDi.218), listed on 21 April 2006</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

In August 2010, Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.217), a leading figure in JAT and Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), appointed Achwan as acting and supreme leader of JAT. Achwan had served on JAT\u2019s executive council since 2008.</p> <p>Achwan has performed a number of leadership duties in JAT, overseeing the allocation of funds and promoting its terrorist training, recruitment, and operations. In May 2011, Achwan hosted a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, to discuss JAT\u2019s financial status and methods for finding new revenue sources and donations. Later, in June of 2011, Achwan requested that certain JAT funds be given to senior Jemaah Islamiyah network leader and Al-Qaida (QDe.004) operative Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.293).</p> <p>In late 2010, Achwan inducted new JAT recruits and instructed its members to participate in physical training to prepare for acts of violence. Also in late 2010, Achwan directed paramilitary training in Poso, Indonesia, with another Jemaah Islamiyah and JAT member. In November 2010, Achwan instructed JAT\u2019s \u201cLaskar 99\u201d (a special JAT unit involved in weapons training) to unconditionally support violent activities throughout the world, and informed them about weapons available to members with the requisite training.</p> <p>In an August 2010 Indonesian press interview, Achwan said he had no intention of giving up his \u201cobligation\u201d to wage violence, and he condoned the use of violence against the Indonesian police\u2019s anti-terrorism squad Detachment 88.

On returning to Egypt in the 1990s, Muhammad Jamal became a top military commander and head of the operational wing of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) which was then, headed by current Al-Qaida leader Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006). Muhammad Jamal has been arrested multiple times by Egyptian authorities for EIJ-related terrorist activities and spent years in prison.</p> <p>Muhammad Jamal formed the Muhammad Jamal Network (QDe.136) after his release from prison in 2011 and established multiple terrorist training camps in Egypt and Libya. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has provided funding to the Muhammad Jamal Network (MJN). Muhammad Jamal has used the AQAP network to smuggle fighters into MJN training camps. Suicide bombers are being trained at MJN training camps, and Muhammad Jamal has established links with violent extremists in Europe. Muhammad Jamal set up a training camp in Libya where Libyan and foreign violent extremists were trained. Some of the attackers of the U.S. Mission in Benghazi on 11 September 2012 have been identified as associates of Muhammad Jamal, and some of the Benghazi attackers reportedly trained at MJN camps in Libya.</p> <p>Muhammad Jamal was most recently arrested by Egyptian authorities in November 2012. His confiscated computer contained letters to Al-Zawahiri in which Muhammad Jamal described MJN\u2019s activities including acquiring weapons, conducting training, and establishing terrorist groups in the Sinai, and in which he asked Al-Zawahiri for assistance.</p> <p>Before he was arrested in November 2012, Muhammad Jamal was the leader of the Nasr City Cell (the Cell), whose members have been accused of plotting terrorist attacks inside Egypt. Raids against the Cell in October 2012 recovered a large amount of weapons, explosives, and related material.</p> <p>Muhammad Jamal is a former EIJ leader and is connected to other Al-Qaida senior leaders, including Aiman al-Zawahiri, and AQAP leadership including Nasir \u2018abd-al-Karim \u2018Abdullah al-Wahishi (deceased), and Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Rimi (QDi.282).

Ben Hassine has links to the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014). Prior to his founding of AAS-T, Seifallah ben Hassine was a founder of the Tunisian Combatant Group (QDe.090), which organized the recruitment of volunteers for training in Al-Qaida (QDe.004) related camps in Afghanistan.</p> <p>In February 2011, ben Hassine benefited from a general amnesty, founded AAS-T, and gathered some of his loyalists into the new group. It included the most dangerous Tunisians sympathetic to extremist ideology, and most of them had previously been involved in cases associated with terrorism. AAS-T initially preached extremist ideology, incited anarchy, and called for the targeting of the Tunisian national security forces and army. AAS-T went on to plan and conduct specific attacks.</p> <p>In September 2012, AAS-T was involved in an attack against the United States Embassy and the American Community School in Tunis, Tunisia.</p> <p>In 2013, AAS-T was implicated in the assassination of two Tunisian politicians: in February 2013, Chokri Belaid was assassinated in front of his home by members of AAS-T, and in July 2013, Mohamed Brahmi was assassinated outside his home by members of AAS-T. Also in July 2013, AAS-T murdered National Army soldiers in the Chaambi mountains. On 30 October 2013, AAS-T attempted to carry out suicide attacks against two tourist sites in Tunisia. The first attack took place when a bomber blew himself up outside a hotel in Sousse, Tunisia, resulting in no other fatalities. That same day, police prevented a suicide bombing in Monastir, Tunisia, when they arrested a would-be bomber at the Tomb of Habib Bourguiba.</p> <p>AAS-T has also been involved in recruiting youth in Tunisia for fighting in the Syrian Arab Republic.</p> <p>As of July 2017, Ben Hassine was still a threat because he continued to plan and carry out acts of destruction in Tunisia and was involved with regional terrorist circles.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Tunisian Combatant Group (QDe.090), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>Ansar al-Shari'a in Tunisia (AAS-T) (QDe.143), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>Ansar al Charia Derna (QDe.145), listed on 19 November 2014</p> <p>Ansar al Charia Benghazi (QDe.146), listed on 19 November 2014</p> <p>Tarek ben Habib ben al-Toumi al-Maaroufi (QDi.074), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Sofiane Ben Goumo (QDi.355), listed on 3 September 2015</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

According to an official social media account for ISIL in the Hasakah Governorate of the Syrian Arab Republic as at Dec. 2014, Batirashvili issued an important communiqu\u00e9 ordering the general mobilization of all ISIL provinces to support the group\u2019s efforts in Mosul, Iraq, and to prepare for any emergencies.</p> <p>Earlier in 2014, Batirashvili was described as a member of ISIL's shura council. In May 2013, he was appointed northern commander for ISIL by ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, listed as Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299), with authority over ISIL\u2019s military operations and ISIL\u2019s forces in northern Syria, specifically Aleppo, Al-Raqqah, Latakia, and northern Idlib provinces. As of late 2013, he was the ISIL leader for northern Syria and was located in and around Aleppo Province. He was also in charge of fighters from Chechnya, Russian Federation and elsewhere in the Caucasus region. At this time, Batirashvili led approximately 1,000 foreign fighters for ISIL to attack the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic at Jabal Shuwayhnah, Rif Aleppo, Syrian Arab Republic.</p> <p>Batirashvili pledged allegiance to ISIL and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in mid-2013. In pledging his allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Batirashvili said that some members of the brigade he commanded, Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (not listed), joined him in swearing allegiance to ISIL. According to a December 2013 statement Batirashvili released, his pledge of allegiance to ISIL and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi came after fighting alongside ISIL and following a consultation held among other fighters from Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar.</p> <p>In addition, Batirashvili publicly acknowledged his role as a senior ISIL military commander in a November 2013 public interview with an unofficial ISIL weekly newspaper. In this interview, he acknowledged arriving in the Syrian Arab Republic in March 2012, described his reasons for joining ISIL, and outlined his role as the military commander of ISIL. He also described five separate military operations he led on behalf of ISIL, including the storming of the Syrian government-controlled Ming Airport. Batirashvili acknowledged that his forces broke into 11 Syrian military installations and seized unidentified spoils from eight of them.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), listed on 18 October 2004</p> <p>The Army of Emigrants and Supporters (QDe.148), listed on 6 August 2015</p> <p>Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299), listed on 5 October 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

From then on, its videos and images were primarily published by the German-language violent extremist media outlet <em>Sham Center</em>. In August 2013, this terrorist group fought the Syrian Government troops on several occasions, including taking part in a major offensive against Alawite villages. The leader of this group originates from Georgia and fought for Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131) for many years.</p> <p>Despite a declaration of adherence to Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137) by this terrorist group, the group remains a distinct organization. A video related to the attack on Aleppo prison on 6 February 2014 shows that the group's leader was still acting separately and not as a part of the Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137).</p> <p>Saal appeared in videos entitled \u201cThe Mujahedin carry out an operation in Latakia\u201d and \u201cA lecture by Abu Talha al Almani \u2014 Holiday greetings\u201d, which were posted on the Internet at the end of August 2013. At the end of December 2013, Saal switched to be a fighter of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115). Via the Internet he glorified ISIL\u2019s activities, reported on the fighting and called on his followers to come to Syrian Arab Republic and join ISIL as fighters.</p> <p>Saal took part with other ISIL fighters in the attack on the Sha\u2019ar gas field near Homs in the Syrian Arab Republic on 17 July 2014. In this attack, Saal and his fellow fighters killed at least 90 people, including many civilians working at the plant. Saal can be seen and heard in three videos subsequently recorded in the vicinity of the gas field and then posted on the Internet.</p> <p>Saal remains an active member of ISIL in Syria.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), listed on 18 October 2004</p> <p>Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131), listed on 29 July 2011</p> <p>Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137), listed on 14 May 2014</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

After Isnilon Totoni Hapilon agreed to the plan, the recruits from Indonesia who eventually attended the terrorist training camps were trained in firearm use and basic bomb-making instructions.</p> <p>In March 2016, a senior ISIL official in the Syrian Arab Republic planned to send financial support to ISIL\u2019s network in the-Philippines through Mabanza.

Building on his former experience as an Afghan journalist, his activity as ISIL-K\u2019s spokesperson has increased ISIL-K\u2019s visibility and influence among its followers. His numerous statements and other propaganda activities have encouraged the recruitment of new members, and the perpetration of terrorist acts on behalf of the organization. \u00a0 \u00a0</p> <p>On August 26, 2021, Azam claimed responsibility on behalf of ISIL-K for the suicide attack near Hamid Karzai International Airport, which killed at least 170 Afghans and 13 United States service members and injured 150 more. In his statement, Azam provided details of the attack, including that ISIL-K emir Sanaullah Ghafari (QDi.431) had supervised its execution. \u00a0</p> <p>On March 2, 2021, ISIL-K claimed responsibility for the assassination of three female journalists. The day after their assassination, the ISIL-K news channel Akhbar Wilayah Khorasan circulated a message from Azam entitled, \u201cWe are the People of Action.\u201d In the message, Azam claimed the killing of the three female journalists on behalf of ISIL-K was in retaliation for the Afghan government\u2019s alleged destruction of several ISIL-K populated villages, which reportedly led to the death of women and children. He also stated that these three women were targeted because the Afghan government intended to repatriate captured foreign ISIL-K members to their countries of origin. \u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>On August 3, 2020, ISIL-K claimed responsibility for an attack on a prison in Jalalabad, during which 29 people were killed and 50 others injured. After the attack, ISIL-K\u2019s media outlet released a 20-minute audio message in which Azam provided details on the execution of this attack, highlighting that a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison while members of the group entered the jail and freed hundreds of prisoners. He also provided details on the profiles of the assailants and justified the attack saying that the assault was in keeping with a promise by Sanaullah Ghafari to release the group\u2019s members who were in prison.\u00a0</p> <p>Azam\u2019s propaganda activities have supported ISIL-K in recruiting and inspiring its members to carry out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan. He has written several books and articles narrating stories about jihadists in order to inspire people to join the organization ranks. Excerpts and anecdotes from his books are often shared by supporters on the messaging app Telegram.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan (ISIL - K) (QDe.161), listed on 14 May 2019\u00a0<br/> Sanaullah Ghafari (QDi.431), listed on 21 December 2021</p> <p>Maulawi Rajab (QDi.434), listed on 26 April 2023\u00a0</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

It was formed from the more militant elements of the Moro National Liberation Front, an established separatist movement in the southern Philippines. ASG is based in the southern Philippines, primarily the Sulu archipelago, Tawi Tawi, Basilan and Mindanao. Members also occasionally travel to Manila. ASG often resorts to criminal activity, including murders, bombings, extortion and kidnap for ransom both for financial profit and to promote its agenda.</p> <p>Abdurajak Janjalani was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998. His younger brother replaced him as the leader of the group and was killed in a gun battle with the Armed Forces of the Philippines in September 2006. Then\u00a0Radulan Sahiron (QDi.208) became the new ASG leader.</p> <p>ASG has links to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092), and ASG members have been trained by both organizations in guerrilla warfare, military operations and bomb making. Usama bin Laden\u2019s (deceased) brother-in-law, Mohammad Jammal Khalifa, used an organization to channel funds to ASG to pay for training and arms.</p> <p>ASG has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including assassinations; bombing civilian and military establishments and domestic infrastructure, including airports and ferries;<u> </u>kidnapping local officials and foreign tourists; beheading local and foreign hostages; and extortion against local and foreign businesses. For example:</p> <ul> <li>in April 2000, an ASG group kidnapped 21 people from a Malaysian holiday resort;</li> <li>in May 2001, ASG members kidnapped three American citizens and 17 Filipinos from a resort in Palawan, Philippines.

While there was no definitive claim of responsibility, three suspected ASG members were arrested during a subsequent raid on a safe-house;</li> <li>in January 2009, ASG kidnapped three International Red Cross workers in Sulu province, holding one of the hostages for six months.</li> </ul> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Isnilon Totoni Hapilon (QDi.204), listed on 6 December 2005</p> <p>Radulan Sahiron (QDi.208), listed on 6 December 2005</p> <p>Umar Patek (QDi.294), listed on 19 July 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Its members conduct insurgent and terrorist acts primarily in Kashmir. HUM trains its militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In mid-February 2000, long-time leader Fazlur Rehman Khalil stepped down as HUM emir, handing over the leadership to the second-in-command, Farooq Kashmiri. Khalil was linked to Usama bin Laden (deceased) and signed a decree in February 1998 calling for attacks on Untied States and other Western interests. HUM operated terrorist training camps in eastern Afghanistan until they were destroyed in 2001.</p> <p>HUM has conducted a number of operations against Indian troops and civilian targets in Kashmir. The group is linked to the Kashmiri militant group Al-Faran which kidnapped five tourists in Kashmir in July 1995; one was killed in August 1995 and the other four were reportedly killed in December of the same year. HUM was responsible for the hijacking of an Indian airliner on 24 December 1999, which resulted in the release of Masood Azhar, an important leader in the former Harakat ul-Ansar, an a.k.a. of HUM, who had been imprisoned by the Indian authorities in 1994. Ahmad Omar Sheikh, who was later arrested for the abduction/murder in January-February 2002 of American journalist Daniel Pearl, was also released at the same time.</p> <p>In addition, HUM has been involved in a number of terrorist activities, including hijacking, bombings, abductions, and training. Terrorist activities for which responsibility has been claimed by or reliably attributed to HUM over the past ten years include:</p> <ul> <li>November 2000: 30 Indian soldiers killed at two army posts in Kashmir;</li> <li>January 2002: The abduction and subsequent murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl. Four people, including HUM member Ahmed Omar Sheikh, were convicted for Pearl\u2019s murder;</li> <li>June 2002: A suicide car-bomb attack outside the United States Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, which killed 11 persons;</li> <li>June 2005: The arrest, in Afghanistan, of several HUM trained individuals preparing to carry out acts of terrorism;</li> <li>June 2005: The arrest of two American citizens for suspected participation in an Al-Qaida plot to attack the United States. Both claimed to have attended a terrorist training camp run by HUM leader Fazlur Rehman Khalil;</li> <li>November 2006: The shooting of a former Special Police Officer in Kashmir accused by HUM of collaborating with a police operations group;</li> <li>February 2007: The kidnapping and subsequent beheading of a Hindu businessman in Pakistan\u2019s Sindh Province.</li> </ul> <p>HUM has several thousand armed supporters located in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and India's southern Kashmir and Doda regions. Its members are mostly Pakistanis and Kashmiris, but also include Afghans and Arab veterans of the Afghan war. They use light and heavy machine guns, assault rifles, mortars, explosives and rockets. HUM has lost a significant number of its members in defections to Jaish-i-Mohammed (QDe.019).</p> <p>HUM has collected donations from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf and Islamic states as well as from Pakistan and India. HUM's financial collection methods include soliciting donations through magazines and pamphlets. The sources and amounts of HUM\u2019s military funding are unknown. In anticipation of asset seizures by the Pakistani Government, HUM withdrew funds from bank accounts and invested in legal businesses, such as commodity trading, real estate and production of consumer goods. Its fundraising in Pakistan has been constrained since the government clampdown on extremist groups and freezing of terrorist assets.</p> <p>HUM has cooperated with other listed militant groups operating in Afghanistan, Kashmir and Pakistan such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118) and Jaish-i-Mohammed. On 16 December 2006, leaders of HUM and Lashkar i Jhangvi (LJ) (QDe.096) called for a joint strategy and pledged to cooperate with Afghan insurgents to target the <em>International Security Assistance Force</em> (<em>ISAF</em>) in Afghanistan.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jaish-i-Mohammed (QDe.019), listed on 17 October 2001</p> <p>Lashkar i Jhangvi (LJ) (QDe.096), listed on 3 February 2003</p> <p>Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p>Mohammed al Ghabra (QDi.228), listed on 12 December 2006</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

For example, IAA publicly declared its support for the 1998 attacks by Al-Qaida against the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It later extended its support for Bin Laden after the United States\u2019 retaliatory strikes on Al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan.</p> <p>IAA has claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on American and British interests in Yemen, and has threatened Western doctors and tourists in the country. On 28 December 1998, IAA gunmen kidnapped 16 western tourists in Yemen and demanded the release of several of its militants who had been arrested a week earlier. Yemeni security forces stormed the IAA hideout where the hostages were being held. Four hostages died in the raid. Al-Hassan was executed in 1999 for his role in the kidnapping. IAA also played a role in the 12 October 2000 bombing of the American warship USS Cole in Aden Harbor, Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors and injured 39 others. The attack was sponsored and conducted in coordination with Al-Qaida.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Hassan Dahir Aweys (QDi.042), listed on 9 November 2001</p> <p>Mostafa Kamel Mostafa Ibrahim (QDi.067), listed on 24 April 2002</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Al-Qaida (QDe.004) leaders encouraged the formation of IMU and Usama bin Laden (deceased) supplied most of the funding to set up the organization. IMU, under the leadership of Tohir Abdulkhalilovich Yuldashev (deceased), has embraced Usama bin Laden's ideology. IMU has close ties with Al-Qaida and the Taliban; senior IMU leaders have held positions in the Al-Qaida hierarchy.</p> <p>Before October 2001, IMU primarily targeted Uzbekistan interests and was responsible for several explosions in Tashkent in February 1999. In August 1999, IMU militants took hostage four Japanese geologists and eight Kyrgyz soldiers; and in August 2000, they took hostage four American mountain climbers. Since October 2001, IMU has focused its attacks on <em>International Security Assistance Force</em> (<em>ISAF)</em> troops in Afghanistan, alongside the Taliban and Al-Qaida.</p> <p>IMU has also been active in terrorist operations in Central Asia. IMU was responsible for explosions in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, in December 2002, and Osh, Kyrgyzstan, in May 2003 that killed eight people. In May 2003, Kyrgyz security forces disrupted an IMU cell that was seeking to bomb the United States Embassy and a nearby hotel in Bishkek. In November 2004, IMU was blamed for an explosion in Osh that killed one police officer and one terrorist. Government authorities in Tajikistan arrested several IMU members in 2005.</p> <p>A group of IMU fighters broke away from the organization to form the Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119). The defection of IMU fighters to the Islamic Jihad Group has not diminished its capability and intent to conduct terrorist attacks.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119), listed on 1 June 2005</p> <p>Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131), listed on 29 July 2011</p> <p>Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) (QDe.132), listed on 29 July 2011</p> <p>Doku Khamatovich Umarov (QDi.290), listed on 10 March 2011</p> <p>Monir Chouka (QDi.300), listed on 25 January 2012</p> <p>Yassin Chouka (QDi.301), listed on 25 January 2012</p> <p>Fazal Rahim (QDi.303), listed on 6 March 2012</p> <p>Ayyub Bashir (QDi.311), listed on 18 October 2012</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

It was created in 1995 by Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan and had plotted against the Government of Libya. LIFG participated with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (QDe.089) in planning the May 2003 bombings in Casablanca, Morocco, that killed over 40 people and injured more than 100. LIFG has also been linked to the 2004 attacks in Madrid, Spain.</p> <p>In 2002, an Al-Qaida leader\u00a0was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan, accompanied by at least three LIFG operatives and a fourth individual, the former head of the Sanabel Relief Agency Limited (defunct) in Kabul, Afghanistan, who was also known to have ties to LIFG. LIFG commanders, including Abu Yahya al-Liby and the now-deceased Abu al-Laith al-Liby, have occupied prominent positions within Al-Qaida\u2019s senior leadership.</p> <p>On 3 November 2007, LIFG formally merged with Al-Qaida. The merger was announced via two video clips produced by Al-Qaida\u2019s propaganda arm, Al-Sahab. The first clip featured Usama bin Laden\u2019s (deceased) deputy, Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), and the second featured Abu Laith al-Liby, who then served as a senior member of LIFG and a senior leader and trainer for Al-Qaida in Afghanistan.</p> <p>LIFG is believed to have several hundred members or supporters, mostly in the Middle East and Europe. Since the late 1990s, many LIFG members have fled from Libya to various Asian, Arabian Gulf, African, and European countries, particularly the United Kingdom. It is likely that LIFG has maintained a presence in eastern Libya and has facilitated the transfer of foreign fighters to Iraq.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (QDe.089), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>The Tunisian Combatant Group (QDe.090), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Hassan Dahir Aweys (QDi.042), listed on 9 November 2001</p> <p>Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr Tantoush (QDi.057), listed on 11 January 2002</p> <p>Merai Zoghbai (QDi.223), listed on 2 August 2006</p> <p>Aly Soliman Massoud Abdul Sayed (QDi.229), listed on 8 June 2007</p> <p>Salem Nor Eldin Amohamed al-Dabski (QDi.231), listed on 8 June 2007</p> <p>Sofiane Ben Goumo (QDi.355), listed on 3 September 2015</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

GSPC was a splinter entity of the Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006), which was the largest and most extreme terrorist group in Algeria at the time. GSPC was renamed AQIM in January 2007 following the group\u2019s union with Al-Qaida (QDe.004), which was announced by Al-Qaida leader Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006) on 11 September 2006.</p> <p>AQIM has conducted numerous attacks against Algerian security and law enforcement bodies and facilities in connection with its stated objective of overthrowing the Algerian Government and establishing an Islamic caliphate. Following its formal alliance with Al-Qaida, AQIM expanded its aims and declared its intention to attack Western targets. In late 2006 and early 2007, it conducted several attacks against convoys of foreign nationals in Algeria. In December 2007, AQIM attacked the United Nations office in Algiers, killing 17, at the same time as it attacked the Algerian Constitutional Council.</p> <p>GSPC, and then as AQIM, has abducted numerous foreigners for ransom, starting in February 2003 with 32 tourists in the south of Algeria, then others in Tunisia, Niger, Mali and Mauritania.</p> <p>AQIM\u2019s leader is Abdelmalek Droukdel (QDi.232). The group operates primarily in the northern coastal areas of Algeria and in parts of the desert regions of southern Algeria, northern Mali, eastern Mauritania and western Niger. Its sources of funding include financial support from cells in Europe, extortion and kidnapping.</p> <p>The Mouvement pour l\u2019Unification et le Jihad en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest (MUJAO) (QDe.134) is a splinter group of AQIM.</p> <p>In October 2011, AQIM\u2019s leader, Abdelmalek Droukdel (QDi.232), wanted cover to expand the agenda of his terrorist organization into the Sahel and increase its territorial control over northern Mali.</p> <p>AQIM wanted to create an ostensibly independent movement that would hide its true roots by abandoning the name \u201cAl-Qaida\u201d. AQIM suggested that the new group be led by Iyad ag Ghali (QDi.316). Since its establishment, Ansar Eddine (QDe.135) and its leader, Iyad ag Ghali, have enjoyed AQIM\u2019s continual support:</p> <ul> <li>Military support: from the battle at Aguelhok on 24 January 2012 to the offensive in early January 2013 against southern Mali, Ansar Eddine received backing from AQIM in its fight against the Malian Armed Forces, notably in the capture of the towns of Aguelhok on 24 January 2012; Tessalit on 10 March 2012; Kidal on 30 March 2012; Gao on 30 March 2012; and Timbuktu on 1 April 2012.</li> <li>Financial support: Iyad ag Ghali received a payment of 400,000 euros from one of the leaders of an AQIM brigade in the Sahel, the Tariq ibn Ziyad Brigade.</li> <li>Logistical support: originally comprising some 50 men close to Iyad ag Ghali, Ansar Eddine has welcomed numerous AQIM fighters.</li> </ul> <p>The ties between Ansar Eddine and AQIM have grown stronger since November 2012.</p> <ul> <li>November 2012: offices were established north of Gao by a mission combining Ansar Eddine, MUJAO and AQIM.</li> <li>November 2012: an alliance was concluded between Ansar Eddine, MUJAO and AQIM and a common strategy was defined.</li> <li>25 November 2012: Iyad ag Ghali expressed his support for AQIM\u2019s ideology.</li> </ul> <p>Since the start of Operation Serval, Iyad ag Ghali has aligned himself with AQIM and MUJAO brigades that are fighting the French and Malian armed forces.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Armed Islamic Group (QDe.006), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (QDe.089), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>Tunisian Combatant Group (QDe.090), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>Mouvement pour l\u2019Unification et le Jihad en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest (MUJAO) (QDe.134), listed on 5 December 2012</p> <p>Muhammad Jamal Network (MJN) (QDe.136), listed on 21 October 2013</p> <p>Ansar Eddine (QDe.135) listed on 20 March 2013</p> <p>Al Mouakaoune Biddam (QDe.139), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Al Moulathamoun (QDe.140), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Al Mourabitoun (QDe.141), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'Awati Wal-Jihad (Boko Haram) (QDe.138), listed on 22 May 2014</p> <p>Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis-Sudan (Ansaru) (QDe.142)), listed on 26 June 2014</p> <p>Ansar al-Shari'a in Tunisia (AAS-T) (QDe.143), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>Ansar al Charia Derna (QDe.145), listed on 19 November 2014</p> <p>Ansar al Charia Benghazi (QDe.146), listed on 19 November 2014</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Omar Mahmoud Uthman (QDi.031), listed on 17 October 2001</p> <p>Mohamed ben Belgacem ben Abdallah al-Aouadi (QDi.060), listed on 24 April 2002</p> <p>Mohamed Aouani (QDi.062), listed on April 24 2002</p> <p>Sami ben Khamis ben Saleh Elsseid (QDi.064), listed on 24 April 2002</p> <p>Abd el Kader Mahmoud Mohamed el Sayed (QDi.065), listed on 24 April 2002</p> <p>Adel ben al-Azhar ben Youssef ben Soltane (QDi.068), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Yassine Chekkouri (QDi.070), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Mehdi ben Mohamed ben Mohamed Kammoun (QDi.072), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Tarek ben Habib ben al-Toumi al-Maaroufi (QDi.074), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Abdelhalim Hafed Abdelfattah Remadna (QDi.075), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Isam Ali Mohamed Alouche (QDi.076), listed on 3 September 2002</p> <p>Mokhtar Belmokhtar (QDi.136), listed on 11 November 2003</p> <p>Saifi Ammari (QDi.152), listed on 4 December 2003</p> <p>Djamel Lounici (QDi.155), listed on 16 January 2004</p> <p>Kamel Djermane (QDi.167), listed on 3 May 2004</p> <p>Habib ben Ahmed al-Loubiri (QDi.177), listed on 23 June 2004</p> <p>Abdelmalek Droukdel (QDi.232), listed on 27 August 2007</p> <p>Yahia Djouadi (QDi.249), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Amor Mohamed Ghedeir (QDi.250), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Salah Eddine Gasmi (QDi.251), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Ahmed Deghdegh (QDi.252), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Djamel Akkacha (QDi.313), listed on 5 February 2013</p> <p>Iyad ag Ghali (QDi.316) listed on 25 February 2013</p> <p>Muhammad Jamal Abd-Al Rahim Ahmad Al-Kashif (QDi.318), listed on 21 October 2013</p> <p>Mohamed Lahbous (QDi.319) listed on 24 October 2013</p> <p>Abubakar Mohammed Shekau (QDi.322), listed on 26 June 2014</p> <p>Hamada Ould Mohamed El Khairy (QDi.315), listed on 22 February 2013</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

The 1994 Harakat ul-Mujahidin / HUM (QDe.008) kidnappings of American and British nationals in New Delhi and the July 1995 kidnappings of tourists in Kashmir were two of several previous efforts to free Azhar.</p> <p>Azhar formed JiM with support from Usama bin Laden (deceased), the Taliban, and several other extremist organizations.</p> <p>On 1 October 2001, JiM claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly building in Srinagar, Kashmir, that killed at least 31 persons; it later denied the claim. JiM and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118) were implicated in the 13 December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament that killed nine and injured 18.</p> <p>JiM has several hundred armed supporters located in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and in India\u2019s southern Kashmir and Doda regions. Supporters are mostly from Pakistan and Kashmir, but also include Afghans and Arab veterans of the Afghan war. Most of JiM's cadre and material resources are drawn from the militant groups Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (HUJI) (QDe.130) and HUM.</p> <p>JiM is based in Peshawar and Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, but members conduct terrorist activities primarily in Kashmir. They also co-operate with the Taliban in attacks against Afghan government and <em>International Security Assistance Force</em> (<em>ISAF</em>) targets in Afghanistan. JiM maintained training camps in Afghanistan until the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001.</p> <p>JiM has had close ties with both Al-Qaida (QDe.004), and the Taliban. Usama bin Laden is believed to have provided funds to JiM. In anticipation of asset seizures by the Pakistani Government, JiM has withdrawn funds from bank accounts and invested in businesses such as commodity trading, real estate and the production of consumer goods. JiM members have also set up two organizations registered in Pakistan as humanitarian aid agencies: Al-Akhtar Trust International (QDe.121) and Alkhair Trust. JiM hoped to give the impression that the two new organizations were separate entities and sought to use them as a way to deliver arms and ammunition to its members under the guise of providing humanitarian aid to refugees and other needy groups.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al Rashid Trust (QDe.005), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Harakat ul-Mujahidin / HUM (QDe.008), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p>Al-Akhtar Trust International (QDe.121), listed on 17 August 2005</p> <p>Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (QDe.130), listed on 6 August 2010</p> <p>Abdur Rehman (QDi.309), listed on 14 March 2012</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Since its establishment, ETIM has maintained close ties with the Taliban, Al-Qaida (QDe.004) and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010). It was founded by Hasan Mahsum from Xinjiang, China, who was killed by Pakistani troops in October 2003. ETIM is currently led by Abdul Haq (QDi.268), who was also a member of Al-Qaida\u2019s Shura Council as of 2005.</p> <p>Since January 2007, ETIM has, again, become active under the sanctuary and with the support of the Taliban and Al-Qaida. Its members have increased to about 200 with the recruitment of some non-Chinese to the organization. Its organizational structure has been strengthened, its scale enlarged, its internal administration has become more sophisticated, and the group has developed its weaponry, equipment and operational capacity.</p> <p>ETIM is currently active in South Asia, Central Asia and the <em>Xinjiang</em> Uygur Autonomous Region of China.</p> <p>In recent years, ETIM has set up bases outside China to train terrorists and has dispatched its members to China to plot and execute terrorist acts including bombing buses, cinemas, department stores, markets and hotels. ETIM has also undertaken assassinations and arson attacks and has carried out terrorist attacks against Chinese targets abroad. Among the violent acts committed by ETIM members were the blowing up of the warehouse of the Urumqi Train Station on 23 May 1998, the armed looting of 247,000 RMB Yuan in Urumqi on 4 February 1999, an explosion in Hetian City, Xinjiang, on 25 March 1999 and violent resistance against arrest in Xinhe County, Xinjiang, on 18 June 1999. These incidents resulted in the deaths of 140 people and injuries to 371.</p> <p>By September 2002, the Chinese police forces had confiscated from ETIM members 98 guns of various types, 4500 antitank grenades, and a large amount of knives, explosive devices and raw materials and equipment for making explosives.</p> <p>In 2007, ETIM sent its key members into China to establish terrorist training camps and to carry out terrorist training activities. On 5 January 2007, when Chinese authorities made arrests, the group resisted with arms, killing one policeman and injuring another. During this operation, several members of this cell were arrested and a large number of explosives and materials for making explosives were seized.</p> <p>In 2007, ETIM also started to send its operatives to China to recruit members covertly. In January 2008, Chinese police succeeded in arresting heads and key members of a terrorist cell, discovering several hideouts, and seizing a large number of explosives and materials for making explosives.</p> <p>At the beginning of March 2008, ETIM sent its operatives to China in an attempt to kidnap foreign reporters, tourists and athletes. This cell covertly collected various materials for making explosives, identified technicians with expertise in making guns and explosives, looked for suicide bombers and attempted to carry out terrorist acts through suicide bombings in Urumqi and other cities inside China. On 26 March 2008, Chinese authorities arrested several cell members and seized a large number of explosives, detonators and other explosive devices.</p> <p>In early January 2008, Abdul Haq directed ETIM\u2019s military commander to attack cities in China, particularly focusing on the eight cities hosting the 2008 Olympic Games. Under Abdul Haq\u2019s direction, trained terrorists planned to sabotage the Games by conducting terrorist attacks in China shortly before they were due to begin.</p> <p>After the Beijing Olympics, ETIM continued to send members into China, ostensibly for commercial activities, but in fact to look for opportunities to plan and carry out further terrorist attacks, such as car bombings, suicide bombings and poisoning. The organization trained more than 20 terrorists to execute car bombings in China.</p> <p>Since 2008, ETIM has published several terrorist videos on military training, targeting the Beijing Olympics and other events in China. In July and August 2009, ETIM published four videos showing its training activities, with Abdul Haq and other ETIM leaders making speeches inciting Uygurs to launch violent acts against China.</p> <p>There is evidence indicating that ETIM members also took steps to plan attacks against the interests of the United States, including the United States Embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. On 22 May 2002, two suspected ETIM members were deported to China from Kyrgyzstan on the ground that they were planning terrorist attacks. The Kyrgyz government stated that the two men were planning to target embassies in Bishkek, as well as trade centers and public gathering places. One of them, Mamet Yasyn was found to have conducted surveillance of several embassies and market places.</p> <p>ETIM has a close financial relationship with Al-Qaida. The major sources of funding for ETIM activities came from Usama bin Laden (deceased) and Al-Qaida and from organized crime such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and looting. ETIM identifies and recruits criminals and terrorists who have fled China and secretly provides them with terrorist training.</p> <p>ETIM has received significant support from Al-Qaida and the Taliban, and previously from Usama bin Laden and has sent its members to Al-Qaida and Taliban training camps. Upon completion of training, ETIM members have traveled to Afghanistan, Kashmir, Chechnya of the Russian Federation, and China to conduct terrorist and other violent acts. ETIM is also considering using Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan as transit routes for the illegal transfer of fighters to China.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Abdul Haq (QDi.268), listed on 15 April 2009</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

The threat posed by JI is compounded by its development as a network that stretches over several countries in Southeast Asia. JI\u2019s ultimate aim is the creation of a state based on extremist ideology which stretches across most of Southeast Asia.</p> <p>Although JI remains an independent organization, making its own operational decisions, active networking by senior JI members has built its links with other terrorist groups, both local and international. JI has a common ideology with Al-Qaida and many members of the two organizations have a shared experience of training or fighting in Pakistan and Afghanistan during the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>A key figure linking JI and Al-Qaida was JI\u2019s chief of operations, Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin (QDi.087), a.k.a. Hambali, who was also a member of Al-Qaida. Hambali fought in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s and was responsible for establishing a network of militant cells across Southeast Asia in the 1990s. He was a close associate of Ramzi Yousef, currently in jail in the United States of America for his involvement in the attack on the World Trade Center on 26 February 1993. Hambali was also closely associated with individuals, including Ramzi Yousef, responsible for planning a coordinated bombing campaign against 12 United States commercial flights from Asia to the West Coast of the United States in January 1995.</p> <p>Hambali was instrumental in arranging for JI members to receive training in Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan, and a number of JI members detained in Singapore have admitted attending such camps. Hambali was also linked to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. He facilitated the visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000 of several Al-Qaida operatives, among whom Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were involved in hijacking and crashing American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon on 11 September 2001.</p> <p>Another key JI figure with links to Al-Qaida is Fathur Rohman al-Ghozhi (deceased). Al- Ghozhi attended an Al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan between 1993 and 1994 before establishing a JI cell in the Philippines around 1996.</p> <p>In addition to these personal associations between JI and Al-Qaida, other links exist between the two groups. JI surveillance video tapes, including tapes of potential bombing targets in Singapore, were recovered in 2001 from the ruins of the house of Al-Qaida military commander, Mohamed Atef, listed as Sobhi Abdel Aziz Mohamed el Gohary Abu Sinna (deceased), in Afghanistan. An Al-Qaida member was a key operative in the JI-planned bombings uncovered in Singapore in December 2001 and had provided operational assistance and funding to JI. In addition to dispatching JI operatives to Afghanistan for training, the Malaysian JI cell was responsible for establishing several front companies that could be used to channel Al-Qaida funds and procure weapons and bomb-making material.</p> <p>JI has both the capability and intent to conduct terrorist attacks and has perpetrated such acts in an indiscriminate manner against diplomatic, civilian and military targets across the region:</p> <ul> <li>JI members planned to bomb the diplomatic missions of Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States in Singapore as well as other United States and Singapore targets in Singapore. The plot was foiled when the Singaporean authorities arrested 13 members of the group in December 2001. They subsequently arrested another 21 persons, including a number of JI operatives, in August 2002. Singaporean authorities have reported that in retaliation for the December 2001 arrests, JI was planning to crash a plane into Changi International Airport in Singapore.</li> <li>A JI leader and explosives expert, Fathur Rohman al-Ghozhi, admitted to helping plan and finance a series of bombings in the Philippines on 30 December 2000 that killed 22 persons and injured more than 100. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in the Philippines for possession of explosives and passport offences.</li> <li>JI\u2019s chief of operations, Hambali, is wanted by the Indonesian authorities in connection with a series of coordinated bombings of Indonesian churches in Jakarta and eight other cities on 24 December 2000 that killed 18 persons and injured many others. According to a JI member, Hambali was also involved in the bombing of the residence of the Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia on 1 August 2000. That bombing killed two persons and seriously injured the Ambassador. Another associate of Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir, Agus Dwikarna (QDi.111), was sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Philippines for illegal possession of explosives.</li> <li>JI was responsible for bombings in Bali on 12 October 2002, which killed 202 persons. It was also behind the bombing of J.W. Marriot Hotel, Jakarta in 2003 and the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004. JI was also responsible for the bombings in Bali in 2005.</li> </ul> <p>Authorities in Southeast Asia continue to regard JI as a threat and to launch operations against it. These include Malaysia\u2019s arrest of two JI leaders in January 2008, and a succession of security force operations in Indonesia since August 2006. The arrests of associates of JI military leader Abu Dujana in March 2007 resulted in the discovery of significant amounts of explosive materiel, firearms, ammunition and pipe bombs. Further investigation led to the eventual arrest of JI emir Zarkasih and military commander Abu Dujana in June 2007. Nevertheless, JI is likely to have other as yet undiscovered caches of explosive materiel for future use.</p> <p>While JI regional links likely persist, disruption by State authorities in the region has resulted in JI having to scale down its previous organizational structure from four \u201cMantiqi\u201d territorial areas of responsibility, previously encompassing parts of Southeast Asia and Australia, to essentially only <em>Mantiqi II</em>covering Indonesia. JI has adopted a centralized structure that covers outreach activities, education, logistics and military affairs.</p> <p>JI continues to recruit covertly from its network of boarding schools and study groups and through personal contacts. It continues to conduct limited training in Indonesia and the southern Philippines. JI funds its activities through donations from its members, criminal activity and affiliated business activity.</p> <p>JI has no acknowledged leader but has a well-ordered succession plan, especially in the case of the arrest of the incumbent emir. Following arrests in June 2007, investigations revealed that Zarkasih had assumed the role of emergency JI emir in 2004, following the arrest of Abu Rusdan (QDi.186) who had assumed the position following the arrest of Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir. Zarkasih was the JI emir until his arrest in 2007, since which time no new emir has been publicly identified.</p> <p>JI\u2019s membership is not publicly known and is estimated to be anywhere from less than one thousand to several thousand members, mostly concentrated in Java but also spread throughout the rest of Indonesia, and neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Since August 2006, JI has not succeeded in conducting any terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia. However, within Indonesia, JI engaged in sectarian terrorist activities such as assassinations and bombings, principally in Poso, Central Sulawesi, until disrupted by Indonesian authorities in January 2007.</p> <p>Within the Southeast Asia region, JI has continued to maintain active links with sub-groups of the Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001) \u2013 particularly through JI operatives Dulmatin, listed as Joko Pitono (deceased) and Umar Patek (QDi.294).</p> <p>While fugitive in the Philippines, JI operatives have taken the opportunity to facilitate attacks with local terrorist groups against Philippine interests on the island of Mindanao. Multiple bombings with a JI signature were conducted on 10 October 2006 and 10 January 2007.</p> <p>Despite the cumulative effects of disruption by regional authorities, the information and materiel seized during the arrests of JI leaders since 2006 demonstrate that JI retains the capability and intent to use terrorist violence.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001), listed on 6 October 2001<br/> Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br/> Rajah Solaiman Movement (QDe.128), listed on 4 June 2008<br/> Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT) (QDe.133), listed on 12 March 2012</p> <p>Hilal Ahmar Society Indonesia (HASI) (QDe.147), listed on 13 March 2015</p> <p>Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman (QDi.086), listed on 28 January 2003<br/> Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin (QDi.087), listed on 28 January 2003<br/> Agus Dwikarna (QDi.111), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Salim Y Salamuddin Julkipli (QDi.114), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Aris Munandar (QDi.119), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Abdul Hakim Murad (QDi.120), listed on September 2003<br/> Parlindungan Siregar (QDi.122), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Yassin Sywal (QDi.123), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Yazid Sufaat (QDi.124), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Yunos Umpara Moklis (QDi.126), listed on 9 September 2003<br/> Abu Rusdan (QDi.186), listed on 16 May 2005<br/> Aris Sumarsono (QDi.187), listed on 16 May 2005<br/> Abdullah Anshori (QDi.216), listed on 21 April 2006<br/> Abu Bakar Ba'asyir (QDi.217), listed on 21 April 2006<br/> Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan (QDi.218), listed on 21 April 2006<br/> Taufik Rifki (QDi.219), listed on 21 April 2006<br/> Angelo Ramirez Trinidad (QDi.241), listed on 4 June 2008<br/> Hilarion Del Rosario Santos III (QDi.244), listed on 4 June 2008<br/> Abdul Rahim Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.293), listed on 19 July 2011<br/> Umar Patek (QDi.294), listed on 19 July 2011<br/> Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman (QDi.295), listed on 12 August 2011<br/> Mochammad Achwan (QDi.304), listed on 12 March 2012<br/> Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.305), listed on 12 March 2012</p> <p>Angga Dimas Pershada (QDi.348), listed on 13 March 2015</p> <p>Bambang Sukirno (QDi.349), listed on 13 March 2015<br/> Wiji Joko Santoso (QDi.350), listed on 13 March 2015<br/> \u00a0</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

The organization also provided cover and immigration assistance to fighters traveling in and out of Pakistan.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, in an effort to attract more donations and deflect scrutiny from the group, Benevolence International Foundation (\u201cAl Bir al Dawalia\u201d in Arabic) was created and incorporated in the United States. Under its new name of Al Bir al Dawalia, the organization engaged in financial transactions on behalf of Al-Qaida (QDe.004). When BIF\u2019s operations came under government scrutiny in and around 1993, Enaam Arnaout assumed control of the organization.</p> <p>Arnaout and Usama bin Laden (deceased) had a close relationship dating from the mid-1980s and continuing until at least the early 1990s. Arnaout functioned as an administrator for Bin Laden, at times disbursing funds on his behalf. An article published in 1988 on Bin Laden\u2019s activities at the \u201cAl Masada\u201d fighters\u2019 camp in Afghanistan included a photograph of Arnaout and Bin Laden walking together.</p> <p>In a March 2002 search of BIF\u2019s offices, Bosnia and Herzegovina law enforcement authorities recovered hard drives and CD-ROMs, some of whose contents had been deleted. An examination of the saved data and restoration of the deleted files revealed a host of evidence linking Aranout to Bin Laden and Al-Qaida, including letters between Arnaout and Bin Laden using their aliases. In one handwritten letter, Bin Laden indicated that Arnaout was authorized to sign on Bin Laden\u2019s behalf. A second letter from Bin Laden to Arnaout discussed consulting Sobhi Abdel Aziz Mohamed al Gohary Abu Sinna (deceased), a.k.a. Muhammad Atef, regarding the establishment of a group of fighters. Atef, Bin Laden\u2019s aide, was indicted for his role in the 1998 United States Embassy bombings in East Africa. In a third letter dated 17 June 1991, Bin Laden wrote to Arnaout to discuss an unspecified prior agreement between them.</p> <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities also discovered an organization chart for a group headed by Bin Laden and involved in military activity; an organization chart placing Arnaout at the head of an organization involved with weapons; and notes summarizing several meetings that witnessed the founding of Al-Qaida in Afghanistan in August 1998 and specifying the text of the original bayat (oath of allegiance) made by prospective Al-Qaida members. Various documents also established that Arnaout, while employed by BIF predecessor Lajnar al-Birr al-Islamiah, worked with others including members of Al-Qaida to purchase rockets, mortars, rifles, and offensive and defensive bombs, and to distribute them to various fighters\u2019 camps, including camps operated by Al-Qaida.</p> <p>BIF reportedly no longer operates in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u00a0 Its successor, Bosanska Idealna Futura, stopped working in Bosnia and Herzegovina by decision of the Ministry of Justice (decision number 04-05-2-458 dated 7 July 2011), and subsequently was delisted domestically on 26 November 2012.\u00a0</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

The attackers threatened that unless the Russian Government met their demands they would kill the hostages. They said that they were prepared to kill themselves and the hostages by blowing up the theater. One hundred and twenty-nine hostages died during the rescue mounted by the Government of the Russian Federation.</p> <p>Basayev, the then leader of both RSRSBCM and IIB, subsequently publicly claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of RSRSBCM. Basayev\u2019s claim was supported by a videotape broadcast on Al Jazeera during the Dubrovka Theater incident showing one of the perpetrators identifying himself as a member of the \u201cSabotage and Military Surveillance Group of the Riyadh al-Salikhin Martyrs\u201d, which is an alias for RSRSBCM.</p> <p>IIB was led by Basayev and the late Saudi national Ibn al-Khattab. Its members include fighters from Chechnya as well as from Arab states.</p> <p>IIB and SPIR and their leaders are closely linked and have cooperated from the period between the two Chechen wars (1997-1999) until the present. While its existence was unknown prior to the Dubrovka Theater incident, RSRSBCM has drawn its members and leaders from IIB and SPIR. In addition to their participation in the 23 October 2002 terrorist attack on the Dubrovka Theater, IIB, SPIR and RSRSBCM have been linked to other terrorist attacks, or have threatened terrorist attacks, against both civilian and government targets.</p> <p>Numerous ties link the leadership of these entities with Al-Qaida (QDi.004), the Taliban and Usama bin Laden (deceased). In October 1999, emissaries of Basayev and Al-Khattab traveled to Usama bin Laden\u2019s home base in the Afghan province of Kandahar, where Bin Laden agreed to provide substantial military assistance and financial aid, including by making arrangements to send to Chechnya several hundred fighters to fight against Russian troops and perpetrate acts of terrorism. Later that year, Bin Laden sent substantial amounts of money to Basayev, Movsar Barayev (leader of SPIR) and Al-Khattab, which was to be used exclusively for training gunmen, recruiting mercenaries and buying ammunition. Following the death of Al-Khattab, Abu al-Walid became a key leader of IIB with Basayev. Before his death in December 2002, Abu al-Walid\u2019s deputy, Abu Tariq, who was also involved in channeling funds from foreign sources to Chechen extremists, had received several million dollars from international terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaida.</p> <p>Al-Khattab (while leader of IIB) publicly admitted that he spent the period between 1989 and 1994 in Afghanistan and that he had met Bin Laden. In March 1994, Basayev arrived in Afghanistan and toured fighter training camps in Khost province. He returned to Afghanistan with the first group of Chechen militants in May 1994. Basayev underwent training in Afghanistan and had close connections with Al-Qaida. Several hundred Chechens eventually trained in Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. With Al\u2011Qaida\u2019s financial support, Al-Khattab also mobilized fighters from Ingushetia, Ossetia, Georgia and Azerbaijan to fight in Chechnya and Dagestan. By August 1995, substantial numbers of those fighting against Russian troops were \u201cAfghan Arabs\u201d (Arabs who had combat experience in Afghanistan against Soviet troops). The support was often reciprocated.

The attackers threatened that unless the Russian Government met their demands they would kill the hostages. They said that they were prepared to kill themselves and the hostages by blowing up the theater. One hundred and twenty-nine hostages died during the rescue mounted by the Government of the Russian Federation.</p> <p>Basayev, the then leader of both RSRSBCM and IIB, subsequently publicly claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of RSRSBCM. Basayev\u2019s claim was supported by a videotape broadcast on Al Jazeera during the Dubrovka Theater incident showing one of the perpetrators identifying himself as a member of the \u201cSabotage and Military Surveillance Group of the Riyadh al-Salikhin Martyrs,\u201d which is an alias for RSRSBCM.</p> <p>A website affiliated with Chechen separatist groups, the Kavkaz Center, also identified one of the leaders of the hostage-takers in the Dubrovka Theater to be Movsar Barayev, the then-commander of SPIR and also a commander of RSRSBCM (Barayev died in the Dubrovka Theater incident). SPIR, which had been headed by Barayev and his uncle, the late Arbi Barayev, provided leadership and personnel to RSRSBCM for its takeover of the Dubrovka Theater. In fact, the Dubrovka Theater incident was originally attributed solely to SPIR since Barayev was the first publicly identified leader of the operation.</p> <p>While its existence was unknown prior to the Dubrovka Theater incident, RSRSBCM has drawn its members and leaders from IIB and SPIR. In addition to their participation in the 23 October 2002terrorist attack on the Dubrovka Theater, IIB, SPIR and RSRSBCM have been linked to other terrorist attacks, or have threatened terrorist attacks, against both civilian and government targets.</p> <p>On 20 November 2002, Basayev, as the leader of RSRSBCM, publicly warned the member states of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that they were now considered targets for future attacks. Basayev wrote that:</p> <p>\u201cWe address you in order not to let you say in the future that we had not warned you about the inevitable outcome\u2026Your stance is a hypocritical one based on a policy of double standards, and it is clearly a pro-Russian stance\u2026All military, industrial, and strategic facilities on the Russian territory, to whoever they belong, are a legitimate military target for us.\u201d</p> <p>RSRSBCM and Basayev continued to be active after the Dubrovka Theater incident. On 27 December 2002, Chechen suicide bombers penetrated the well\u2011fortified Chechen Administration complex in downtown Grozny before detonating their explosives. The blast left over 80 people dead and over 150 wounded. Basayev claimed in an interview that not only was he involved in the blast but that he personally pressed the button of the remote control detonation device.</p> <p>Numerous ties link the leadership of these entities with Al-Qaida (QDi.004), the Taliban and Usama bin Laden (deceased). In October 1999, emissaries of Basayev and Al-Khattab (deceased), who was a leader of IIB, traveled to Usama bin Laden\u2019s home base in the Afghan province of Kandahar, where Bin Laden agreed to provide substantial military assistance and financial aid, including by making arrangements to send to Chechnya several hundred fighters to fight against Russian troops and perpetrate acts of terrorism. Later that year, Bin Laden sent substantial amounts of money to Basayev, Barayev and Al-Khattab, which were to be used exclusively for training gunmen, recruiting mercenaries and buying ammunition. Before his death in December 2002, a deputy leader of IIB, Abu Tariq, who was also involved in channeling funds from foreign sources to Chechen extremists, had received several million dollars from international terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaida.</p> <p>Al-Khattab (while leader of IIB) publicly admitted that he spent the period between 1989 and 1994 in Afghanistan and that he had met Bin Laden. In March 1994, Basayev arrived in Afghanistan and toured fighter training camps in Khost province. He returned to Afghanistan with the first group of Chechen militants in May 1994. Basayev underwent training in Afghanistan and had close connections with Al-Qaida. Several hundred Chechens eventually trained in Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. With Al-Qaida\u2019s financial support, Al-Khattab also mobilized fighters from Ingushetia, Ossetia, Georgia and Azerbaijan to fight in Chechnya and Dagestan. By August 1995, substantial numbers of those fighting against Russian troops were \u201cAfghan Arabs\u201d (Arabs who had combat experience in Afghanistan against Soviet troops), according to published reports. The support was often reciprocated. Al-Qaida\u2019s select \u201c055 Brigade,\u201d which fought against the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, included a number of Chechens, many of whom were believed to be followers of Basayev, Barayev and Al-Khattab. In October 2001, Al-Khattab sent additional fighters to Afghanistan and promised to pay the volunteers\u2019 families a substantial monthly stipend or a large lump-sum payment in the event of their death. In 2002, Al-Qaida was attempting to raise USD 2 million to support Abu al-Walid, who had succeeded Ibn al-Khattab in the leadership of IIB as the new Arab Chechen leader.</p> <p>The RSRSBCM was involved under the leadership of Aslan Byutukaev (QDi.396) in suicide bombings in Moscow in 2003-2004, the school siege in Beslan, North Ossetia-Alania, in September 2004, as well as the 24 January 2011 terrorist attack on Domededovo International airport in Moscow. RSRSBCM members and Aslan Byutukaev (QDi.396) personally organized the murder of Yuriy D. Budaev, former Colonel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on 10 June 2011 in Moscow.</p> <div> <div> <p>\u00a0</p> </div> </div> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Islamic International Brigade (IIB) (QDe.099), listed on 4 March 2003</p> <p>Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR) (QDe.101), listed on 4 March 2003</p> <p>Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131) listed on 29 July 2011</p> <p>Doku Khamatovich Umarov (QDi.290), listed on 10 March 2011</p> <p>Aslan Avgazarovich Byutukaev (QDi.396), listed on 3 August 2016</p> <p>\u00a0</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

When viewed as a single entity, Al-Haramain was one of the principal NGOs active throughout the world providing support for the Al-Qaida network. Funding generally came from individual benefactors and special campaigns which targeted selected business entities around the world.</p> <p>The Al-Haramain branches in\u00a0Kenya (QDe.105), Tanzania (QDe.106), Pakistan, Afghanistan (QDe.110), Albania (QDe.111), Bangladesh (QDe.112), Ethiopia (QDe.113), the Netherlands (QDe.114), and the Union of the Comoros (QDe.116)\u00a0 have provided financial, material and/or technological support to the Al-Qaida network, including Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya /AIAI (QDe.002), the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118).

These terrorist organizations received funding from Al-Haramain and used Al-Haramain as a front for fundraising and operational activities.</p> <p>AHF offices in Kenya and Tanzania provided support, or acted for or on behalf of AIAI and Al-Qaida. AIAI has shared ideological, financial and training links with Al-Qaida and financial links with several NGOs and companies including AHF, which it used to transfer funds. AHF, together with three other NGOs, served as fronts of AIAI in Kenya.</p> <p>As early as 1997, the Kenyan branch of AHF was involved in plotting terrorist attacks against Americans. As a result, a number of individuals connected to AHF in Kenya were arrested and later deported by Kenyan authorities.</p> <p>In August 1997, an AHF employee indicated that the planned attack against the United States Embassy in Nairobi would be a suicide bombing carried out by crashing a vehicle into the gate of the Embassy. A wealthy AHF official outside East Africa had agreed to provide the necessary funds.</p> <p>Also in 1997, AHF senior activists in Nairobi decided to alter their (then) previous plans to bomb the United States Embassy in Nairobi and instead sought to attempt to assassinate United States citizens. During this period, an AHF official indicated that he had obtained five hand grenades and seven \u201cbazookas\u201d from a source in Somalia. These weapons were to be used in a possible assassination attempt against a United States official.</p> <p>Wadih el-Hage, a leader of the Al-Qaida cell in East Africa and personal secretary to Usama bin Laden, visited the Kenya offices of AHF before the 1998 attacks on the United States Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam. El-Hage possessed contact information for a senior AHF official who was head of AHF\u2019s Africa Committee, the overseeing authority for AHF\u2019s offices in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>AHF (Kenya) was deregistered in 1998, following its alleged links with Al-Qaida and the United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed over 200 people. However, in 1999, AHF (Kenya) successfully contested deregistration in the courts and resumed operations the following year, in 2000.</p> <p>In 2004, AHF (Kenya) started disposing of its assets with a view to winding up its operations. In 2005, AHF sold its premises to another organization. Although AHF has reportedly scaled down its activities and closed its offices, some personalities associated with it may be operating other similar organizations in the country.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Makhtab al-Khidamat (QDe.012), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Al-Haramain Foundation (Pakistan) (QDe.104), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania) (QDe.106), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Afghanistan Branch (QDe.110), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Albania Branch (QDe.111), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Bangladesh Branch (QDe.112), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Ethiopia Branch (QDe.113), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: The Netherlands Branch (QDe.114), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain Foundation (Union of the Comoros) (QDe.116), listed on 28 September 2004</p> <p>Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p>Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani (QDi.028), listed on 17 October 2001</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

It was led by extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, also known as Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased), who was killed in June 2006. Al-Zarqawi had been operating independently in Iraq since mid-2003 using the name Jama\u2019at al-Tawhid Wa\u2019al-Jihad (JTJ). Al-Zarqawi\u2019s group was responsible for the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad that killed at least 23 people, including United Nations Special Envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.</p> <p>JTJ, under Al-Zarqawi, established links to Al-Qaida (QDe.004). Al-Zarqawi had a long-standing connection with the senior Al-Qaida leadership, appeared to be well regarded by them and was a close associate of Usama bin Laden (deceased). He arranged for his followers to be trained in Al-Qaida camps.</p> <p>Since his designation by the 1267 Committee, Al-Zarqawi moved the center of his operations to Iraq and consolidated his group of operatives under JTJ. As the leader of JTJ, his ties to Al-Qaida, however, remained, as evidenced by a letter intercepted in February 2004 that Al-Zarqawi wrote to Al-Qaida/Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan, taking credit for various terrorist attacks.</p> <p>In October 2004 JTJ issued a statement pledging allegiance to Usama bin Laden, and undertook to follow Bin Laden\u2019s orders. At this time the group also changed its name to Tanzim Qa\u2019idat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (the Al-Qaida Group in the Land of the Two Rivers, AQI). The group\u2019s stated aim is the creation of a state in Iraq based on extremist ideology.</p> <p>Following Al-Zarqawi\u2019s death in 2006, Abu Ayyub al-Masri assumed leadership of AQI until his own death in April 2010. The group continues to attack Iraqi civilians, the Iraqi Security Forces, and Iraqi governmental institutions. It has claimed many terrorist attacks inside Iraq including the high-profile attacks in Baghdad in August, October and December 2009, which, combined, killed over 480 people. The group also claimed responsibility for the 2005 attack on three hotels in Amman, Jordan, which killed at least 60 people.</p> <p>Members of JTJ\u2019s precursor cell operating in Germany include Djamel Moustfa (QDi.129).</p> <p>Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137) a.k.a Jabhat al Nusrah emerged publicly on 24 January 2012. The group was created by members of Al-Qaida in Iraq including, in particular, Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali Al-Badri Al Samarrai, also known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (QDi.299). It operates in Syria where it has carried out a number of terrorist attacks. The leader of Jabhat al Nusrah is Al-Fatih Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani (QDi.317).The group was part of Al Qaida in Iraq and was listed between 30 May 2013 and 13 May 2014 as an alias of Al-Qaida in Iraq.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant (QDe.137), listed on 14 May 2014</p> <p>Ansar al Charia Derna (QDe.145), listed on 19 November 2014</p> <p>The Army of Emigrants and Supporters (QDe.148), listed on 6 August 2015</p> <p>Omar Mahmoud Uthman (QDi.031), listed on 17 October 2001</p> <p>Djamel Moustfa (QDi.129), listed on 23 September 2003</p> <p>Hamid Abdallah Ahmed al-Ali (QDi.236), listed on 16 January 2008</p> <p>Jaber Abdallah Jaber Ahmad al-Jalahmah (QDi.237), listed on 16 January 2008</p> <p>Mubarak Mushakhas Sanad Mubarak al-Bathali (QDi.238), listed on 16 January 2008</p> <p>Redouane el Habhab (QDi.262), listed on 12 November 2008</p> <p>Akram Turki Hishan al-Mazidih (QDi.276), listed on 11 March 2010</p> <p>Ghazy Fezza Hishan al-Mazidih (QDi.277), listed on 11 March 2010</p> <p>Muthanna Harith al-Dari (QDi.278), listed on 25 March 2010</p> <p>Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299), listed on 5 October 2011</p> <p>Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani (QDi.317), listed on 24 July 2013</p> <p>Abou Mohamed al Adnani (QDi.325), listed on 15 August 2014</p> <p>Hamid Hamad Hamid al-\u2018Ali (QDi.326), listed on 15 August 2014</p> <p>'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi (QDi.334), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>\u2018Abd al-Rahman Khalaf \u2018Ubayd al-\u2018Anizi (QDi.335), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>Anas Hasan Khattab (QDi.336), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>\u2018Abd al-Rahman Muhammad Mustafa al-Qaduli (QDi.339), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>Emilie Konig (QDi.340), listed on 23 September 2014</p> <p>Ashraf Muhammad Yusuf 'Uthman 'Abd al-Salam (QDi.343), listed on 23 January 2015</p> <p>Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili (QDi.345), listed on 23 January 2015</p> <p>Tarak ben Taher ben Faleh Ouni Harzi (QDi.354), listed on 10 April 2015</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

IJU was formed when it broke away from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) (QDe.010). IJU was founded and led by Najmiddin Kamolitdinovich Jalolov (deceased) and Suhayl Fatilloevich Buranov (deceased).</p> <p>IJU conducted a number of suicide bombings (and other attacks) at a local bazaar and against Uzbek police targets in Tashkent, and detonated explosives at a house in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, between 28 March and 1 April 2004. On 11 April 2004, IJU issued a statement, claiming responsibility for all terrorist operations in Uzbekistan. The statement said such operations would continue.</p> <p>On 30 July 2004, IJU conducted coordinated bombing attacks in Tashkent against the Embassies of the United States of America and Israel and the office of the Prosecutor General, killing at least two people and wounding nine. On the same day, IJU issued a statement, claiming responsibility for these attacks. The statement indicated that further attacks were planned.</p> <p>In September 2007, the authorities in Germany detained three IJU operatives, disrupting an IJU plot against unidentified United States or other facilities in Germany. The operatives had acquired about 700 kg of hydrogen peroxide and an explosives precursor, which they secretly stockpiled in a garage in southern Germany. This was enough raw material to make the equivalent of approximately 1,200 lbs of TNT. IJU subsequently claimed responsibility for the foiled plot.</p> <p>IJU also claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 2008 against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) forces, including a March suicide attack against a US guard post that killed four people.</p> <p>IJU operatives conducted a bombing attack in the Andizhan region of Uzbekistan on 26 May 2009, which killed one person and wounded 16 people. IJU claimed responsibility for this attack.</p> <p>According to one IJU operative arrested in connection with the March-April 2004 attacks in Bukhara, IJU leader Jalolov considered his Leader to be Mullah Omar, listed as Mohammed Omar Ghulam Nabi (TAi.004) on the 1988 Sanctions List); Jalolov also had direct ties with Usama bin Laden (deceased).</p> <p>Jalolov received special training on mines and explosives at the Al-Qaida (QDe.004) camp in Khost province, Afghanistan. Jalolov and Buranov also participated in military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan in support of the Taliban.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001<br/> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001<br/> Emarat Kavkaz (QDe.131) listed on 29 July 2011<br/> Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) (QDe.132), listed on 29 July 2011<br/> Adem Yilmaz (QDi.261), listed on 27 October 2008<br/> Doku Khamatovich Umarov (QDi.290), listed on 10 March 2011</p> <p><em>Related individuals and entities on the 1988 Sanctions List:</em></p> <p>Mohammed Omar Ghulam Nabi (TAi.004), listed on 31 January 2001</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Jaish-i-Mohammed sought to use Al-Akhtar Trust as a way to deliver arms and ammunition to its members under the guise of providing humanitarian aid to refugees and other needy groups. Al-Akhtar Trust International was established for the purpose of providing financial assistance for fighters, financial support to the Taliban, and food, clothes, and education to orphans of \u201cmartyrs\u201d. At a ceremony in Islamabad celebrating the establishment of the trust, one of the senior leaders of Harakat ul-Mujahidin (QDe.008), termed the establishment of Al-Akhtar Trust as \u201ccommendable\u201d. There was an appeal to the people to support it generously.</p> <p>The chairman and chief executive of Al-Akhtar Trust stated that his organization\u2019s services for the Taliban and Mullah Omar, listed as Mohammed Omar Ghulam Nabi (TAi.004 on the 1988 Sanctions List) were known to the world.</p> <p>As of mid-November 2001, the Al-Akhtar Trust was secretly treating wounded members of Al-Qaida (QDe.004) at the medical centers it was operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> <p>In 2003, a senior Al-Qaida detainee related that Al-Akhtar Trust together with Al Rashid Trust (QDe.005) were the primary relief agencies that Al-Qaida used to move supplies into Kandahar, Afghanistan. While Al-Qaida was based in Kandahar, Afghanistan, these organizations provided donations in the form of blankets and clothing to Al-Qaida members.

Ahmad Islam Santos (QDi.244). Santos is considered to be the emir of the RSM.</p> <p>RSM recruits have received training, funds, and operational assistance from the Al-Qaida- affiliated Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) (QDe.001) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) (QDe.092). The RSM, in return, has provided field operatives and a pool of potential recruits, enabling the ASG and JI to expand their reach into urban areas in the Philippines. RSM members have been involved in several plots to bomb high-profile targets in Manila, including public utilities, tourist areas, and the Embassy of the United States of America.</p> <p>The links between the RSM and the ASG are illustrated by the fact that, at the time of his arrest on 26 October 2005 in Zamboanga city, the Philippines, Hilarion Santos III was also the media bureau chief of the ASG.</p> <p>The links between the RSM and JI were acknowledged by Hilarion Santos III when he confessed that, in early 2004, he had collaborated with Umar Patek (QDi.294), a JI member. Patek gave the RSM 250,000 Philippine pesos for the foiled \u201cBig Bang\u201d or \u201cGreat Ibadah\u201d operation, which was intended to target the Embassy of the United States of America in Manila and business establishments frequented by foreigners, in particular Americans. The money was spent on surveillance of targets and to pay for the rental of an apartment in Quezon City which the RSM used to store explosives. Philippines government security forces raided the apartment on 23 March 2005 and recovered the explosives. When Fathur Rohman al-Ghozhi (deceased), a key operative of JI, escaped from the detention of the Philippine National Police on 14 July 2003, he sought refuge at the residence of an RSM contact in Camarines Sur before proceeding to Butuan City in Mindanao.</p> <p>Santos also admitted that he had trained potential bombers together with JI as early as February 2002. After their training courses, ASG and RSM members participated in a series of joint bombing attacks and other plots orchestrated on behalf of JI and the ASG in Metro Manila and Mindanao that killed or wounded hundreds of people, such as the Superferry 14 attack (27 February 2004), the G-Liner bombing plot (25 December 2004), the Valentine\u2019s Day bombing (14 February 2005), and nearly simultaneous bombings in Mindanao at a bus terminal in Davao City and at a shopping mall in General Santos City.</p> <p>Selected RSM members were recruited by JI through the ASG to conduct bomb attacks. In preparation, RSM recruits underwent JI- and ASG-sponsored training, particularly in handling explosives and the manufacture of improvised explosives devices (IED). Consequently, the graduates of these training courses became bombers or provided operational support, such as by acquiring components for IEDs or casing targets.</p> <p>RSM members underwent training on explosives under JI instructors in Mount Cararao, located on the boundary of Maguindanao and Lanao Del Sur Provinces in the Philippines in 2002, after they had sought refuge inside ASG camps in Mindanao following the raid by the Philippine National Police on their training camp in Anda, Pangasinan. In 2004, JI instructors conducted another training programme for RSM members on demolition and explosives, and firearms familiarization, called \u201cKital Jihad\u201d, in Camp Jabal Quba, Mount Cararao, Maguindanao, the Philippines.</p> <p>The RSM has received funding from an orginzation linked to Mohammad Jamal Khalifa, a brother-in-law of Usama bin Laden (deceased), through Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani (deceased), the head of the ASG.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Abu Sayyaf Group (QDe.001), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092) listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Angelo Ramirez Trinidad (QDi.241), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Dinno Amor Rosalejos Pareja (QDi.242), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Feliciano Semborio Delos Reyes, Jr. (QDi.243), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Hilarion Del Rosario Santos III (QDi.244), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Pio Abogne De Vera (QDi.245), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Redendo Cain Dellosa (QDi.246), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. (QDi.247), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Ricardo Perez Ayeras (QDi.248), listed on 4 June 2008</p> <p>Umar Patek (QDi.294), listed on 19 July 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

AQAP members have been responsible for planning and carrying out attacks against the US Embassy in Yemen, tourists, aid workers, counterterrorism officials and oil facilities in Yemen, as well as targets elsewhere. An organization under the same name had previously carried out attacks in Saudi Arabia between 2004 and 2006.</p> <p>Since its formation in 2009, AQAP has carried out two suicide bombings against South Korean tourists and government officials in Yemen, killing four; and, in June 2009, AQAP kidnapped nine foreign nationals in Yemen, killing three.

By 2005, Mohammad Ilyas Kashmiri (deceased), a HUJI leader, coordinated activities with the Taliban and Al-Qaida from Waziristan. Kashmiri issued a statement in October 2009 (after he had been reported as deceased) that he was alive and working with Al-Qaida. By 2010, a significant number of HUJI operatives were involved in terrorist operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan.</p> <p>HUJI has planned and carried out a number of terrorist attacks in recent years. A HUJI leader planned the suicide bombing of the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, which killed four people and injured 48 on 2 March 2006. On 18 May 2007, HUJI and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118) conducted a joint bombing operation against the historic mosque in Hyderabad, India, which killed 16 people and injured 40. HUJI also killed 42 people and injured 50 with twin explosions on 25 August 2007 in Hyderabad, India. Moreover, on 23 November 2007, near simultaneous blasts outside courts in Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow, India, killed at least 13 people and injured 59. HUJI is believed to be responsible for these attacks. Ilyas Kashmiri (deceased) has been indicted in the United States for providing material support to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba operative David Coleman Headley who planned a terrorist attack against the Jyllands-Posten newspaper offices in Denmark.</p> <p>Detained HUJI leader Jalaluddin (a.k.a. Babu Bhai) has admitted HUJI\u2019s involvement in funding the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. Part of the ransom paid in a July 2001 HUJI-executed kidnapping was funneled to 11 September hijacker Mohammad Atta via HUJI leader Mohammad Asif Raza and another individual.</p> <p>Composed primarily of Pakistani nationals and veterans of the Soviet-Afghan war, HUJI was originally founded in 1980 in Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet Union. HUJI later re-focused its efforts in South Asia following the Soviet withdrawal. In 1991, a faction broke away from the group to form Harakat ul-Mujahidin / HUM (QDe.008). In 1993, HUJI re-joined with HUM to form Harakat ul-Ansar (HUA). In 1997, HUJI split from the HUA organization and resumed using its former name.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Harakat ul-Mujahidin / HUM (QDe.008), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jaish-i-Mohammed (QDe.019), listed on 17 October 2001</p> <p>Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> <p>Mati ur-Rehman Ali Muhammad (QDi.296), listed on 22 August 2011</p> <p>Abdur Rehman (QDi.309), listed on 14 March 2012</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

By a decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 8 February 2010, it was recognized as a terrorist organization and its activities were prohibited on Russian territory on the grounds that its members plan and perpetrate terrorist acts with the intent of violating the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and fomenting ethnic and religious conflict.</p> <p>The ideological basis of this terrorist organization is the notion of establishing a State based upon extremist ideology in the North Caucasus and further extending it to the Volga region and European countries through armed combat and terror.</p> <p>The active formation of the Caucasus Emirate began in 2004 and was proclaimed in October 2007 by its leader and spiritual inspiration Doku Khamatovich Umarov (QDi.290). In a videotaped statement on the establishment of the Caucasus Emirate, Doku Umarov stated, inter alia, \u201cI do not think there is any need to draw the borders of the Caucasus Emirate. That is firstly because the Caucasus is a war zone occupied by infidels and apostates and our next task is to make the Caucasus a purely Islamic area by instituting sharia in the land and driving out the infidels. Secondly, once the infidels have been driven out, we must take back all lands that were historically Muslim, and those borders lie beyond the borders of the Caucasus\u201d. At the same time, Doku Umarov called on his supporters to engage in war not only against the Russian State but also against all states.</p> <p>In May 2009, Doku Umarov established a consultative body (the Majlis ul-Shura) comprising nine emirs who are leaders of large groups (or <em>jamaats</em>). The shura is empowered, in particular, to select a new emir of the Caucasus Emirate upon the death of the previous leader.</p> <p>The organization also has an official representative office abroad (headed by Shamsuddin Batukayev). According to the latest information, the emirate has cells in countries in Europe and the Near East.</p> <p>The Caucasus Emirate has past connections to several listed entities, including the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010) and the Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119). In a statement released in May 2009, Doku Umarov took credit for restoring the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs (RSRSBCM) (QDe.100), a group previously led by Shamil Basayev (deceased) and responsible for a number of high profile attacks in Russia. Since 2009, the RSRSBCM has publicly taken credit for several terrorist attacks in Russia and claimed that they act on the direct order of Umarov.</p> <p>Since July 2010, Aslambek Vadalov has been the deputy (or <em>naib</em>) of the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. For a long time, the \u201cCommander of the Armed Forces\u201d was Ali Taziyev (aka \u201cMagas\u201d, currently in detention), who participated in the hostage-taking of schoolchildren in Beslan in September 2004 and in an attack on the Republic of Ingushetia, the Russian Federation. The \u201cChief of the Security Service\u201d is Tarkhan Gaziyev.</p> <p>The judicial branch is represented by the \u201cSupreme Sharia Court\u201d presided over by an Islamic judge. This position was held by Anzor Astemirov (one of the organizers of the attack on Nalchik by militants in 2005; in March 2010 he put up armed resistance to his apprehension and was killed) and subsequently by Magomedali Vagabov (the main organizer of the March 2010 terrorist attacks at the Lubyanka and Park Kulturi metro stations in Moscow; he was killed during his apprehension on 21 August 2010).</p> <p>The Kavkazcenter has been proclaimed the official information organ of the Emarat Kavkaz by Doku Umarov. Publications on the website are in Russian, English, Arabic, Turkish and Ukrainian. The main address is <em>Kavkazcenter.com</em>. The additional web portals are <em>Kavkazcenter.info</em>, <em>Kavkazcenter.net</em>, <em>Kavkaz.org.uk</em> and <em>Kavkaz.tv</em>. The principal internet provider of the website is located in Stockholm, Sweden. In March 2008 it published \u201cConcept of the Islamic State\u201d. Since 2007 the website has regularly published videos in which Doku Umarov and the heads of the Emarat Kavkaz have taken personal responsibility for terrorist acts carried out on the territory of Russia including the one at the Domodedovo airport (Moscow) on 24 January 2011.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs (RSRSBCM) (QDe.100), listed on 4 March 2003</p> <p>Islamic Jihad Union (QDe.119), listed on 1 June 2005</p> <p>Doku Khamatovich Umarov (QDi.290), listed on 10 March 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Formed under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud, who has since died, TTP is rooted along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border.\u00a0Some estimates suggest that TTP has between 30,000 and 35,000 members.</p> <p>TTP\u2019s stated objective is the overthrow of the elected government of Pakistan in order to establish an emirate based on its interpretation of Islamic law. To that end, TTP has worked to destabilize Pakistan by directly attacking the Pakistani army and assassinating politicians.</p> <p>TTP attacks, which have included multiple suicide bombings, have killed hundreds of members of the Pakistan defense forces, law enforcement personnel and civilians. Baitullah Mehsud, TTP\u2019s leader at the time, publicly claimed credit for the 30 March 2009 attack on a police academy in Lahore, Pakistan, in which the attackers fired automatic machine guns into an unarmed crowd of police recruits, killing eight people and wounding 100 others. Following Pakistan\u2019s military operations against Al-Qaida-affiliated groups (in particular the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010) and the Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119)) in South Waziristan in September 2009, TTP claimed a number of high profile suicide attacks which aimed to \u201cpunish\u201d the government and bring about a change of policy. TTP also claimed responsibility for the suicide attack on the World Food Programme headquarters in Islamabad in October 2009, and for an attack in July 2010 which killed over 50 people waiting to receive relief supplies outside the office of a senior government official in Mohmand Tribal Agency, Pakistan. Other attacks include the double suicide bombing of an administrative building in Mohmand Agency in December 2010, which killed over 40 people, and an attack on a Pakistan army compound in Mardan in February 2011, which killed 31. In May 2011, TTP operatives stormed the Mehran naval base in Karachi and killed at least 10 Pakistani security officers.</p> <p>TTP also claimed responsibility for an attempted bombing in Times Square, New York, USA, on 1 May 2010, and in April 2010 it launched a multi-pronged assault against the United States Consulate in Peshawar, killing at least six Pakistanis and wounding 20 others.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QE.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (QDe.010), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Islamic Jihad Group (QDe.119), listed on 1 June 2005</p> <p>Aamir Ali Chaudhry (QDi.312), listed on 18 October 2012</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

JAT claims to seek to establish an Islamic caliphate in Indonesia. JAT\u2019s aims and methods in promoting terrorism in Indonesia show its support for Al-Qaida (QDe.004).</p> <p>JAT was formed on July 27, 2008 in Solo, Indonesia. The founder and leader of JAT, Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.217), was convicted and sentenced in 2011 to 15 years in prison for his role in organizing a militant training camp in Aceh, Indonesia. Ba\u2019asyir is also the co-founder and former leader of Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), the organization responsible for the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed more than 200 people.</p> <p>On September 25, 2011, a member of JAT detonated explosives attached to his body inside a Christian church in Central Java, wounding dozens. Indonesian police arrested other JAT members in connection with this bombing and uncovered a plot for additional suicide attacks. In April 2011, a suicide bomber attacked a mosque in a police compound in West Java, injuring dozens of police officers. Police arrested several JAT members in connection with this bombing. JAT has conducted bank robberies and other criminal activities to fund the purchase of weapons and bomb-making materials.</p> <p>JAT was divided due to Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir\u2019s swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, listed as Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299). As a result of the pledge, in 2014, Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir\u2019s son and others splintered from JAT and declared a new group. JAT became a group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115); its members have been involved in ISIL operations in South-East Asia.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), listed on 18 October 2004</p> <p>Abu Bakar Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.217), listed on 21 April 2006</p> <p>Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba\u2019asyir (QDi.305), listed on 12 March 2012</p> <p>Mochammad Achwan (QDi.304), listed on 12 March 2012</p> <p>Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299), listed on 5 October 2011</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

This was MUJAO\u2019s first attack.</p> <p>MUJAO co-exists and works together with AQIM from which its operational capabilities derive. MUJAO operates in the same geographical area in the Sahel and shares objectives of AQIM. It grew considerably in its first twelve months of operation.</p> <p>MUJAO is the result of internal struggles within Al Moulathamoun (QDe.140), a part of AQIM headed by Mokhtar Belmokhtar (QDi.136). The causes of those struggles were linked to the leadership of the group, the distribution of ransoms paid for hostages and the sharing of profits from drug trafficking.</p> <p>MUJAO's leaders are known to be drug traffickers involved in the drugs trade in the Sahel and southern Algeria.</p> <p>MUJAO has claimed responsibility for the following operations:</p> <ul> <li>The abduction of three humanitarian workers from a Saharan refugee camp in the region of Tindouf, Algeria, on 23 October 2011.</li> <li>The abduction of seven Algerian diplomats, including the Consul, in Gao, Mali, on 5 April 2012.</li> <li>The attack on the Gendarmerie Nationale base in Tamanrasset, Algeria, on 23 March 2012.</li> <li>The attack on the Gendarmerie Nationale base in Ouargla, Algeria, on 29 June 2012.</li> </ul> <p>Taking advantage of the uprising of rebel movements in northern Mali in early 2012, MUJAO has seized the towns of Gao and Bourem and taken supplies of weapons from Malian arsenals. It is thus heavily armed with, for example, heavy machine guns (14.5 and 23 mm), anti-tank grenade launchers (RPG-7), mortars (60 and 82 mm), conventional (TNT) and home-made explosives, night-vision binoculars and means of communication (mobile and satellite telephones, and VHF radios).</p> <p>In November 2012, an alliance was concluded between MUJAO, Ansar Eddine (QDe.135) and AQIM. A common strategy was defined and offices were established north of Gao by a mission combining MUJAO, Ansar Eddine, and the AQIM.</p> <p>Since the start of Operation Serval, Iyad ag Ghali (QDi.316) has aligned himself with AQIM and MUJAO brigades that are fighting the French and Malian armed forces.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Ansar Eddine (QDe.135) listed on 20 March 2013</p> <p>Al Mouakaoune Biddam (QDe.139), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Al Moulathamoun (QDe.140), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Al Mourabitoun (QDe.141), listed on 2 June 2014</p> <p>Mokhtar Belmokhtar (QDi.136), listed on 11 November 2003</p> <p>Amor Mohamed Ghedeir (QDi.250), listed on 3 July 2008</p> <p>Iyad ag Ghali (QDi.316) listed on 25 February 2013</p> <p>Mohamed Lahbous (QDi.319) listed on 24 October 2013</p> <p>Hamada Ould Mohamed El Khairy (QDi.315) listed on 22 February 2013</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"

Suicide bombers are being trained at MJN training camps, and Muhammad Jamal has established links with violent extremists in Europe. Muhammad Jamal set up a training camp in Libya where Libyan and foreign violent extremists were trained.

Brought Syrian and foreign Al-Qaida in Iraq                 (QDe.115) and Asbat al-Ansar (QDe.007) fighters, along with other foreign Al-Qaida                 operatives, to join local elements in Syrian Arab Republic to carry out terrorist                 and guerrilla operations there. Previously associated with the Islamic State in Iraq                 and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), and its leader Ibrahim                 Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299) but separated from that group in                 2013. In Jul. 2016, Abu Mohammed Al-Jawlani (QDi.317), the leader of Al-Nusrah Front                 for the People of the Levant, announced the group had changed its name to Jabhat                 Fath al-Sham and was no longer affiliated with any external entity. Despite the                 announcement and attempts to distinguish itself from Al-Nusrah Front for the People                 of the Levant, the group remains aligned with Al-Qaida and continues to carry out                 terrorist operations under this new name. In January 2017, Al-Nusrah Front created                 Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a vehicle to advance its position in the Syrian                 insurgency and further its own goals as Al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate in Syria. Previously                 listed between 30 May 2013 and 13 May 2014 as an aka of Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115).

On 9 April 2013, Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai announced the unification of Al-Qaida in Iraq and Al-Nusrah Front under the title of \u201cIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant\u201d. Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai also affirmed that his organization supported and financed cells of fighters from Al-Nusrah Front.</p> <p>Al-Nusrah Front is associated with Al-Qaida (QDe.004). The leader of Al-Qaida, Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), sent two letters to members of Al-Nusrah Front on 27 June 2011 and 7 February 2012, calling for militant actions in Syria. In response to Al-Zawahiri's call, numerous foreign fighters travelled to Syria and carried out terrorist operations that bore all the marks of Al-Qaida, albeit the identity of those who perpetrated them was not revealed. Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani directly declared on 10 April 2013 the Al-Nusrah Front swears allegiance to Aiman al-Zawahiri.</p> <p>Al-Nusrah Front is composed of local and foreign fighters, some of whom fought in Afghanistan and Iraq under the banner of Al-Qaida. They operate together with Syrians who were involved with Al-Qaida, mainly in Iraq and who returned to Syria when unrest began. A large number of members of Al-Qaida in Iraq as well as members of Al-Qaida itself joined Al-Nusrah Front. Further recruits came from Asbat al-Ansar (QDe.007).<br/> Al-Nusrah Front employs murder, destruction, booby-trapped cars and suicide bombings. Operations carried out by Al-Nusrah Front have caused significant material damage and loss of life. The most serious operations that Al-Nusrah Front has claimed responsibility for include the following:</p> <p>1. On 6 January 2012, a terrorist attack in the Maydan quarter of Damascus, Syria, killed 24 soldiers and civilians and injured 140.<br/> 2. On 10 February 2012, two terrorist operations targeted the military security building in Urqub, Syria and a law enforcement corps building in Halab al-Jadidah, Syria, killing 28 and injuring more than 135 soldiers and civilians.<br/> 3.

In 2009 the group carried out a series of attacks on police stations and other government buildings in Maiduguri, which resulted in Nigerian government raids on the group's headquarters and Yusuf's death in those raids. Since then, Boko Haram has been led by Abubakar Mohammed Shekau (QDi.322) and has embarked on a violent insurgency utilizing terrorist tactics. The group is based in north-eastern Nigeria but has also operated in Cameroon and is responsible for attacks and kidnappings in those two countries. Boko Haram has also been active in Chad and Niger.</p> <p>Boko Haram has maintained a relationship with the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) (QDe.014) for training and material support purposes. For example, Boko Haram gained valuable knowledge on the construction of improvised explosive devices from AQIM. A number of Boko Haram members fought alongside Al-Qaida affiliated groups in Mali in 2012 and 2013 before returning to Nigeria with terrorist expertise.</p> <p>Boko Haram is responsible for a series of major terrorist attacks, including a wave of bombings in Kano, Nigeria in January 2012 that killed more than 180 people in a single day. Another major attack was the August 26, 2011 bomb attack on the United Nations headquarters in Abuja that killed at least 21 people and wounded scores more. The group was also responsible for the December 25, 2011 attack on the Saint Theresa Catholic Church in Madalla, Nigeria, that killed at least 37 and wounded approximately 50.</p> <p>Since summer 2012 Boko Haram has undertaken a campaign of violence against Nigerian schools and students. In June 2013, the group attacked schools in Maiduguri and Damaturu, Nigeria, killing at least 22 children; in July, an attack on a school in the village of Mamudo, Nigeria killed at least 42 people, most of them students. On September 29, 2013 Boko Haram attacked an agricultural school in Yobe, Nigeria, shooting dead 50 students in their dormitory as they slept.</p> <p>On April 14, 2014, Boko Haram abducted approximately 300 girls from a school in northern Nigeria. Abubakar Mohammed Shekau claimed responsibility for the attack in a video released by Boko Haram and threatened to sell the girls into slavery. Boko Haram militants subsequently attacked a staging base for rescuers on May 5, 2014, killing an additional 310 people.</p> <p>In a statement released in November 2012, Abubakar Mohammed Shekau expressed Boko Haram\u2019s solidarity with Al-Qaida affiliates in Afghanistan, Iraq, North Africa, Somalia and Yemen. He also encouraged fighters across Africa and other areas to continue engaging in terrorist attacks. Shekau\u2019s media statements have been published on known violent extremist forums.</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Related listed individuals and entities:\u00a0</div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis-Sudan (Ansaru) (QDe.142), listed on 26 June 2014</p> <p>Abubakar Mohammed Shekau (QDi.322), listed on 26 June 2014</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>"
