            <h3 align="center">NARRATIVE SUMMARIES OF REASONS FOR LISTING</h3>
            <u><strong>QI.M.31.01. OMAR  MAHMOUD UTHMAN </strong></u>
			<p><em>Date on which the  narrative summary became available on</em> <em>the  Committee’s website</em>: 9 March 2009</p>
            <p>Omar  Mahmoud Uthman  was listed <strong>on 17 October 2001</strong> pursuant to paragraph  8 (c) of resolution 1333 (2000) as being associated with “Usama bin Laden and  individuals and entities associated with him” for &quot;participating in the  financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts or  activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support&quot;  of Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01.), the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) (QE.A.6.01.),  the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QE.T.14.01.), and Egyptian  Islamic Jihad (QE.A.3.01.).</p>
            <p><em>Additional information:</em></p>
            <p>Omar  Mahmoud Uthman  a.k.a. Abu  Qatada al-Filistini has been involved in terrorism-related activity since at  least 1995 and has been described as the “spiritual ambassador in Europe to Usama bin Laden” (deceased). He is a  significant international terrorism figure and a leading advisor with extensive  links to, and influence over, Al-Qaida-related (QE.A.4.01.) groups in the United Kingdom  and other countries, including the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) (QE.A.46.01.), the  Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC),  listed as the Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb   (QE.T.14.01.) and Al-Jihad/Egyptian Islamic  Movement, listed  as Egyptian  Islamic Jihad  (QE.A.3.01.). He has engaged in conduct which facilitates and gives  encouragement to the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of  terrorism. He has conducted such facilitation by personal contact, telephone,  letters and the Internet.  He also raised  funds for Al-Qaida-related terrorist groups. <u></u></p>
            <p>Omar  Mahmoud Uthman  has  significant and long standing connections with terrorist organizations  operating in Algeria:  the GIA and the GSPC. He was an adviser to the GIA until 1996 and saw himself  as the group’s representative in London.  He allied himself to the more violent elements of the organization, and it is  reported that he told a newspaper in 1995 that the killing of foreigners in Algeria was  justified because they held entry visas issued by an illegal regime. He sent  money to the GIA from London. </p>
            <p>Omar  Mahmoud Uthman provided  financial assistance to Bin Laden’s associates in Amman, Jordan.  He was twice convicted in absentia in Jordan for involvement in terrorist  attacks there in March and April 1998 and in relation to a plot to plant bombs  to coincide with the millennium. He faced a 15-year prison term.<u></u></p>
            <p>Omar  Mahmoud Uthman has  long-established connections with Usama bin Laden and Al- Qaida, and has maintained  close contacts with London-based Al-Qaida associates. He was in close contact  with Khalid  Abd al-Rahman Hamd al-Fawaz  (QI.A.59.02.) who was Bin Laden’s representative in the United Kingdom prior to Al-Fawaz’s arrest in  the United Kingdom  in 1998. In 1998, it was reported that Omar  Mahmoud Uthman  had in the past  received funding directly from Bin Laden. He has repeatedly associated himself  with and expressed his support for him, in particular in a television broadcast  in January 2000 and in an interview in December 2001. He also has links with  Al-Jihad/Egyptian Islamic Movement through Aiman  Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QI.A.6.01.).</p>
            <p>In the late 1990s, he became a  mentor and provided financial support to the GSPC, as well as became an adviser  to Moroccan, Tunisian and Libyan extremist groups. He was also a significant  counselor to the Al-Tawhid movement, listed as Al-Qaida  in Iraq (QE.J.115.04.), whose leader was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, also  known as Ahmad Fadil  Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased).<br>
              <br>
              In 1997, it was reported that he  was actively recruiting for Afghan training camps. In the period 1999-2001 he  played a leading role in the United Kingdom  in raising funds and providing logistic support and recruits for fighters in Chechnya.</p>
            <p>In February 2001, he was arrested  by anti-terrorism police officers in the United   Kingdom because he was suspected of involvement with the  Abu Doha terrorist cell in Frankfurt which had been responsible for plotting to  cause explosions at the Christmas market in Strasbourg, France.  United Kingdom  and foreign currency with a value in excess of £170,000 was found in his  possession. £805 was found attached to a note indicating that it was bound for  fighters in Chechnya.  This money was collected from supporters around Europe and was destined for  both legitimate causes and illegal causes, including funding for training camps  and international terrorist and violent groups in places like Jordan and Chechnya. Omar  Mahmoud Uthman  was  responsible for the safekeeping and distribution of this money. There is also  evidence that he was involved in funding individuals involved in violent  activities in Indonesia. </p>
            <p>In January 2002, it was reported  that persons attending the Fatimah Center mosque in London,  United Kingdom, believed  that he was responsible for organizing trips to Afghanistan for military training.  The Special Immigration Appeals Commission of the United Kingdom (SIAC)  concurred that he encouraged and raised funds for individuals to go to Afghanistan  and considered as probably correct that he had links with Ansar al-Islam  (QE.A.98.03.), that he had given them money and had suggested to them that they  should seek more support from Al-Qaida. </p>
            <p>Omar  Mahmoud Uthman was deported to Jordan  from the United Kingdom  on 7 July 2013 to face terrorism charges.</p>
