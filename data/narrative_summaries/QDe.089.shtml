GICM became a clandestine, transnational terrorist group drawing its membership from the Moroccan diaspora communities of Western Europe. Its goals included supporting Al-Qaida (QDe.004) by helping its operatives to assimilate into Moroccan and European societies.</p> <p>GICM has taken part in the fighting in Afghanistan and has been linked to the structures of Usama bin Laden (deceased). The ideologist of the movement, Ahmed Rafiqi, alias Abou Hodeifa (not listed), was in charge of the Moroccan fighters in Afghanistan. The representative of the GICM in Europe was Mohamed el Gharbouzi (not listed), who was seized by Iranian authorities while crossing the border between Pakistan and Iran at the end of 2001 or beginning of 2002 and extradited to the United Kingdom where he is presently detained. Mohamed el Gharbouzi was convicted in absentia by the Moroccan government for his role in the 2003 terrorist attacks in Casablanca.</p> <p>Other GICM members were also involved in the 2003 Casablanca attacks. GICM members were among those responsible for the 2004 Madrid bombing, and Moroccans associated with the GICM are part of the broader international Al-Qaida-related terrorist movement. GICM members were implicated in the recruitment of individuals to fight in Iraq, and at least one GICM member carried out a suicide attack against the Multi-National Forces there.</p> <p>GICM is mainly located in the United Kingdom but has cells in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Related listed individuals and entities: </div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (QDe.011), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (QDe.014), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>The Tunisian Combatant Group (QDe.090), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>Faycal Boughanemi (QDi.188), listed on 29 July 2005</p> <p>Abdelkader Laagoub (QDi.190), listed on 29 July 2005</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>
