When viewed as a single entity, Al-Haramain was one of the principal NGOs active throughout the world providing support for the Al-Qaida network. Funding generally came from individual benefactors and special campaigns which targeted selected business entities around the world.</p> <p>The Al-Haramain branches in Kenya (QDe.105), Tanzania (QDe.106), Pakistan (QDe.104), Afghanistan (QDe.110), Albania, Bangladesh (QDe.112), Ethiopia (QDe.113), the Netherlands (QDe.114), and the Union of the Comoros (QDe.116) have provided financial, material and/or technological support to the Al-Qaida network, including Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118). These terrorist organizations received funding from Al-Haramain and used Al-Haramain as a front for fundraising and operational activities.</p> <p>Usama Bin Laden may have financed the establishment of the Al-Haramain office in Albania, which was used as cover for terrorist activity in Albania and in Europe. In late 2000, a close associate of a Usama bin Laden operative moved to Albania and was running an unnamed Al-Haramain subsidiary. In 1988, the head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Albania was also a financial official for Al-Haramain. This individual was extradited in 1998 from Albania to Egypt where, during his trial, he voiced his support for Usama bin Laden and Al-Qaida’s August 1998 terrorist attacks against the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Related listed individuals and entities: </div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Egyptian Islamic Jihad (QDe.003), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Jemaah Islamiyah (QDe.092), listed on 25 October 2002</p> <p>Al-Haramain Foundation (Pakistan) (QDe.104), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramayn Foundation (Kenya) (QDe.105), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramayn Foundation (Tanzania) (QDe.106), listed on 26 January 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Afghanistan Branch (QDe.110), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Bangladesh Branch (QDe.112), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: Ethiopia Branch (QDe.113), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain: The Netherlands Branch (QDe.114), listed on 6 July 2004</p> <p>Al-Haramain Foundation (Union of the Comoros) (QDe.116), listed on 28 September 2004</p> <p>Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (QDe.118), listed on 2 May 2005</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>
