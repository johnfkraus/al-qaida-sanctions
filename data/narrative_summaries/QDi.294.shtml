Patek has also trained operatives associated with the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) (QDe.001) and personally developed explosive devices for this Philippines-based organization.</p> <p>As of early 2010, Patek was considered to be one of JI’s top leaders. In his capacity as a leader of the JI network in Mindanao, the Philippines, Patek received approximately $29,000 to cover his expenses and his JI group’s militant activities in the southern Philippines. Patek obtained funding for operations that were to include a large-scale car bombing in metropolitan Manila, attacks on Philippine military camps in Mindanao and assassinations of prominent foreigners.</p> <p>In 2002, Patek was involved in planning and preparing the 12 October 2002 JI Bali bombing, which killed 202 people. A few weeks before the blasts, Patek attended a meeting in Solo, central Java, Indonesia, where participants, including JI leaders Joko Pitono (deceased), also known as Dulmatin, Imam Samudra (deceased) and Mukhlis, who is also deceased, agreed to execute the Bali bombings. Patek was personally involved in assembling the van bomb and explosives used in the Bali attack.</p> <p>As of early 2006, Patek had built bombs for ASG using 60 mm mortar bombs. As of mid-2007, Patek and Dulmatin were teaching ASG members bomb-making techniques to include training in improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The IEDs were intended to block Armed Forces of the Philippines troops who might be in pursuit of JI and ASG. In January 2011, Patek was arrested in Abbotabad, Pakistan, and repatriated seven months later to Indonesia. In June 2012, Patek was convicted for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
