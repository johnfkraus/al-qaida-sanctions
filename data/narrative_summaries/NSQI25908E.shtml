Since the end of 2006, he became the ringleader of a group he formed with Daniel Martin Schneider (QI.S.260.08) and Adem Yilmaz (QI.Y. 261.08) with the objective of carrying out bomb attacks <em>inter alia</em> against institutions of the United States of America in Germany. To this end, the group had acquired a considerable quantity of hydrogen peroxide solution which, when mixed with other components, could have produced an explosive comparable to approximately 550 kilograms of TNT. Furthermore, the group procured the additional means needed for carrying out the attacks - such as, for instance, electrical devices for triggering the detonation - as well as several detonators. The manufactured explosives were to be placed in several vehicles and detonated in Germany outside discotheques and pubs frequented by citizens of the United States of America and/or at an airport, with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible.</p> Gelowicz was arrested on 4 September 2007 in Medebach, Germany and on 4 March 2010, the Higher Regional Court in DÃÂÃÂ¼sseldorf, Germany sentenced him to 12&nbsp;years imprisonment for membership of a terrorist organization abroad, conspiracy to murder, causing an explosion, coercion of constituÃÂÃÂ­tional organs and preparation of a serious criminal offence involving an explosion. <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p> Islamic Jihad Group (QE.I.119.05), listed on 1 June 2005<br> <br> Daniel Martin Schneider (QI.S.260.08), listed on 27 October 2008<br> Adem Yilmaz (QI.Y. 261.08), listed on 27 October 2008<br> MevlÃÂÃÂ¼t Kar (QI.K.302.12), listed on 25 January 2012</p>
