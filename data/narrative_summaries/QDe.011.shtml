It was created in 1995 by Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan and had plotted against the Government of Libya. LIFG participated with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (QDe.089) in planning the May 2003 bombings in Casablanca, Morocco, that killed over 40 people and injured more than 100. LIFG has also been linked to the 2004 attacks in Madrid, Spain.</p> <p>In 2002, an Al-Qaida leader was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan, accompanied by at least three LIFG operatives and a fourth individual, the former head of the Sanabel Relief Agency Limited (defunct) in Kabul, Afghanistan, who was also known to have ties to LIFG. LIFG commanders, including Abu Yahya al-Liby and the now-deceased Abu al-Laith al-Liby, have occupied prominent positions within Al-Qaida’s senior leadership.</p> <p>On 3 November 2007, LIFG formally merged with Al-Qaida. The merger was announced via two video clips produced by Al-Qaida’s propaganda arm, Al-Sahab. The first clip featured Usama bin Laden’s (deceased) deputy, Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), and the second featured Abu Laith al-Liby, who then served as a senior member of LIFG and a senior leader and trainer for Al-Qaida in Afghanistan.</p> <p>LIFG is believed to have several hundred members or supporters, mostly in the Middle East and Europe. Since the late 1990s, many LIFG members have fled from Libya to various Asian, Arabian Gulf, African, and European countries, particularly the United Kingdom. It is likely that LIFG has maintained a presence in eastern Libya and has facilitated the transfer of foreign fighters to Iraq.</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-related-listed-individuals field-type-text-long field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Related listed individuals and entities: </div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya / AIAI (QDe.002), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Al-Qaida (QDe.004), listed on 6 October 2001</p> <p>Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (QDe.089), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>The Tunisian Combatant Group (QDe.090), listed on 10 October 2002</p> <p>Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), listed on 25 January 2001</p> <p>Hassan Dahir Aweys (QDi.042), listed on 9 November 2001</p> <p>Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr Tantoush (QDi.057), listed on 11 January 2002</p> <p>Merai Zoghbai (QDi.223), listed on 2 August 2006</p> <p>Aly Soliman Massoud Abdul Sayed (QDi.229), listed on 8 June 2007</p> <p>Salem Nor Eldin Amohamed al-Dabski (QDi.231), listed on 8 June 2007</p> <p>Sofiane Ben Goumo (QDi.355), listed on 3 September 2015</p> </div></div></div> </article> </div>
