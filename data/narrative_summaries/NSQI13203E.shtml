Jam'at al-Tawhid Wa'al-Jihad (JTJ), which was originally led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, listed as Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh (deceased). Al-Dagma was earlier associated with Al-Khalayleh when both men were in Afghanistan at the end of 2001. The group's main activities consisted of forging passports, collecting donations and facilitating the illegal travel of fighters to Iraq, but it also planned attacks in Germany. Although it operated independently, it followed directives from operational leaders abroad. Al-Dagma formed part of the leadership circle of the group, together with Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess (QI.A.130.03) and others, at least since he returned from Afghanistan in January/February 2002. It is believed that Al-Dagma and Ismail Abdallah Sbaitan Shalabi (QI.S.128.03) were involved in planning an attack against a target in Germany with the knowledge and approval of Abu Dhess.</p> <p>Al-Dagma was convicted in Germany in October 2005 of belonging to a terrorist organization (the German cell of Al-Qaida in Iraq) and of procuring counterfeit official identity papers. He was sentenced to seven years and six months of imprisonment and released having served his sentence in December 2009. </p> <p><em>Related listed individuals and entities:</em></p> <p>Al-Qaida (QE.A.4.01), listed on 6 October 2001<br> Al-Qaida in Iraq (QE.J.115.04), listed on 18 October 2004</p> <p> Ismail Abdallah Sbaitan Shalabi (QI.S.128.03), listed on 23 September 2003<br> Djamel Moustfa (QI.M.129.03), listed on 23 September 2003<br> Mohamed Ghassan Ali Abu Dhess (QI.A.130.03), listed on 23 September 2003</p>
